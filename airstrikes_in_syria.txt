The submarine was in a submerged position during the launch, he added.\n Putin noted that the new cruise missile can be equipped with both conventional and nuclear warheads, adding he hopes that the latter \"will never be needed.\"\n Shoigu said Tu-22 bombers flying from their base in Russia also took part in the latest raids, performing 60 combat sorties in the last three days.\n He said the targets destroyed in the latest wave of Russian airstrikes included a munitions depot, a factory manufacturing mortar rounds and oil facilities belonging to \"terrorists.\"\n Shoigu said the Russian military had informed Israel and the United States about the airstrikes before launching them. A U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to discuss the matter publicly, confirmed that Russia notified the U.S. in advance.\n The U.S. official said at least 10 cruise missiles were launched from Russian surface ships in the Caspian Sea and at least one missile was fired by a Russian submarine in the eastern Mediterranean.\n Russia has carried out its air campaign in Syria since Sept. 30, using warplanes at an air base in Syria's coastal province of Latakia, as well as navy ships and long-range bombers flying from their bases in Russia. While Moscow said its action has been focused on the Islamic State group, the U.S. and its allies have criticized Moscow for also striking moderate rebel groups opposed to Syrian President Bashar Assad.\n Shoigu told Putin that Syrian army forces had overtaken the area near the border with Turkey where a Turkish jet shot down a Russian warplane on Nov 24. He showed Putin the plane's flight recorder, which he said Syrian and Russian troops had recovered from the crash site.\n Putin ordered the flight recorder to be studied in the presence of foreign experts, adding that the data will show the plane's flight path.\n Moscow's relations with Ankara have been badly strained over the downing. Turkey said it shot down the aircraft after it violated Turkey's airspace for 17 seconds despite repeated warnings.\n Russia has insisted the warplane had stayed in Syria's airspace, and responded by deploying long-range air defense missiles at its air base in Syria and introducing a slew of economic sanctions against Turkey.\n \"We had treated Turkey not only as a friendly country, but as an ally in the fight against terrorism, and we couldn't expect such a mean, treacherous stab in the back,\" Putin said.\n Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed Turkey's complaint about a sailor on a Russian navy vessel pictured on its deck with a portable air-defense missile while the ship was cruising across the Bosporus.\n Turkey denounced the incident as a provocation and summoned the Russian ambassador to protest.\n Zakharova responded Tuesday by saying the Russian crew had the right to protect its vessel and insisted that the action didn't contradict the Montreux Convention, which sets international rules for using the Turkish straits.\n Russia's Foreign Ministry also voiced concern Tuesday about the reported bombing of a Syrian army camp without addressing the U.S. claim that Russia was responsible for the bombing.\n The Syrian government blamed aircraft from the U.S.-led coalition for targeting the army camp in the eastern city of Deir el-Zour on Sunday night, killing three Syrian soldiers and wounding 13. The U.S. denied the claim, and a senior U.S. official military said Washington was \"certain\" it was a Russian airstrike that had hit the camp. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to discuss the issue publicly.\n Without commenting on the U.S. claim, Russia's Foreign Ministry on Tuesday said it has \"serious concerns\" about reports of the coalition strike in Deir el-Zour. It said the incident was rooted in the U.S.-led coalition's reluctance to coordinate with Damascus on its campaign against the Islamic State group.\n The ministry also mentioned a coalition strike in Syria's province of Hassake that reportedly involved civilian casualties.\n \"These incidents show that the situation on the front against IS in Syria and Iraq is getting more tense,\" the ministry said, adding that the Turkish military's deployment to a base near Mosul in Iraq without Iraqi government sanction has added to the tensions.\n \"We consider such presence unacceptable,\" the ministry said.\n U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, said Washington expects Turkey to operate in coordination with the Iraqi government.\n \"We have urged political dialogue between the Iraqi government and that in Turkey,\" Power said. \"Our belief is that just as we operate in close coordination with and with the consent of the Iraqi government that all countries should do that.\"\n She voiced hope that the Turkish deployment could \"be done in that manner where a sovereign government is making judgments about which capabilities are deployed and making sure that it has visibility into everything going on in its country.\"\n Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, said that while Russia so far has said 'no' to Iraq's request for help in fighting IS, that attitude may change. He added that the arsenal Russia has put on the ground in Syria signals Moscow's intention to have a lasting military presence.\n \"It's not going to be a short operation, it's not going to be a short war,\" Trenin said. \"Russia is there for a long haul.\"\n AP National Security Writer Robert Burns in Washington, Edith M.

This photo was provided by the Syrian anti-government activist group Ariha Today, and has been authenticated based on its contents and other Associated Press reporting. (Ariha Today/Associated Press)            \nAirstrikes believed to have been carried out by Russian warplanes killed at least 18 civilians and wounded dozens more on Sunday in a northern Syrian town held by insurgents, Syrian opposition media reported.\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the airstrikes struck the town of Ariha, killing at least 18 people, including four children, and wounding dozens more. The Local Coordination Committees, an activist collective, said the airstrikes struck a busy market, inflicting heavy casualties.\nThe Observatory, which relies on a network of activists inside Syria, said the airstrike destroyed three buildings in the centre of Ariha.\nAriha Today, a Facebook page that covers events in the town, said the airstrikes were carried out by Russian warplanes, killing 40 people and wounding more than 70. Conflicting tolls are common in the chaotic aftermath of violent incidents in Syria.\nIf Russian warplanes carried out Sunday's strikes it would be one of the deadliest incidents since Moscow began launching airstrikes in Syria two months ago. Opposition activists say more than 400 civilians have been killed by Russian strikes since the air campaign began on Sept. 30.\nAn amateur video posted online showed several men being treated on the floor of what appeared to be a clinic. Blood stains could be seen on the floor's white tiles. On the street outside, four men could be seen lying near the building, with several young men weeping over them.\nShortly afterward, an ambulance arrived and a wounded man in a wheelchair was carried into the clinic.\nThe video appeared genuine and corresponded to other AP reporting of the event.\nThe Observatory reported several other strikes in the northwestern province of Idlib believed to have been carried out by Russian warplanes on Sunday. It said that an office of the Turkistan Islamic Party, a group that consists mainly of fighters from Asian states, was hit in the town of Jisr al-Shughour and that planes struck a relief office for the ultraconservative Ahrar al-Sham group in the town of Saraqib.\nThe LCC reported airstrikes on a hospital in Idlib, the provincial capital, and other targets in Saraqib.\nRussia says its airstrikes are aimed at ISIS, militants fighting to establish an\u00A0Islamist\u00A0state,\u00A0and other \"terrorists,\" but Western officials and Syrian rebels say most of the strikes have focused on central and northern Syria, where ISIS does not have a strong presence.\nIn the capital Damascus, state media quoted President Bashar\u00A0al-Assad as saying that he is determined to continue fighting \"terrorism in all its forms\" because Syria and its allies are \"confident that eliminating terrorists is the main step in bringing about stability to the region and the entire world.\"\nThe Syrian state news agency SANA said Assad made his comments during a meeting on Sunday with Ali Akbar Velayati, a top adviser to Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who arrived in Damascus earlier in the day. Iran has been one of Assad's strongest supporters over the past years.\nSyria's conflict has killed more than 250,000 people and wounded more than a million since the start of an uprising against\u00A0Assad in 2011.\n", "docSentiment"=>{"mixed"=>"1", "score"=>"-0.37053", "type"=>"negative"}} @url=#<URI::HTTPS:0xa386774 URL:https://gateway-a.watsonplatform.net/calls/url/URLGetTextSentiment?apikey=bc9d67cc85047b79b30187500483a6212581839d&outputMode=json&showSourceText=1&sourceText=cleaned&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Fairstrikes-syria-18-killed-1.3342581> @request=#<Faraday::RequestOptions (empty)> @request_headers={"Accept-Encoding"=>"none", "User-Agent"=>"Faraday v0.9.2"} @ssl=#<Faraday::SSLOptions verify=true> @response=#<Faraday::Response:0xa37b914 ...> @response_headers={"server"=>"nginx", "date"=>"Sat, 12 Dec 2015 19:29:01 GMT", "content-type"=>"application/json", "content-length"=>"4142", "connection"=>"close", "cache-control"=>"no-cache", "x-alchemyapi-currentversion"=>"12.23a", "x-alchemyapi-key"=>"bc9d67cc85047b79b30187500483a6212581839d", "x-alchemyapi-params"=>"sentiment=0&knowledgeGraph=0&detectedLanguage=english&submitLanguage=detect", "x-alchemyapi-raw-content-size"=>"96154", "x-alchemyapi-requested-url"=>"http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/airstrikes-syria-18-killed-1.3342581", "x-alchemyapi-retrieved-url"=>"http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/airstrikes-syria-18-killed-1.3342581", "x-alchemyapi-status"=>"OK", "x-alchemyapi-text-content-size"=>"3622", "x-alchemyapi-total-transactions"=>"1", "access-control-allow-origin"=>"*"} @status=200>>, #<Faraday::Response:0xa361a28 @on_complete_callbacks=[], @env=#<Faraday::Env @method=:get @body={"status"=>"OK", "usage"=>"By accessing AlchemyAPI or using information generated by AlchemyAPI, you are agreeing to be bound by the AlchemyAPI Terms of Use: http://www.alchemyapi.com/company/terms.html", "url"=>"http://www.news1130.com/2015/12/07/syria-says-3-of-its-soldiers-killed-in-us-led-coalition-airstrikes-on-army-camp/", "totalTransactions"=>"1", "language"=>"english", "text"=>"BEIRUT \u2013 Syria on Monday accused the U.S.-led coalition of bombing an army camp in the eastern part of the country, killing three Syrian soldiers and wounding 13, but a senior U.S. military official said the Pentagon is \u201Ccertain\u201D the strike was from a Russian warplane.\nThe dispute over the deadly airstrike underscored the increasingly chaotic skies over Syria as various powers hit targets in the war-ravaged country. The U.S.-led alliance began its airstrikes in Syria in September 2014, while Russia\u2019s air campaign began a year later.\nIn a letter to the United Nations, the government in Damascus said four aircraft from the coalition targeted the army camp in the eastern city of Deir el-Zour on Sunday night. In addition to the casualties among the troops, it said the attack destroyed armoured and other vehicles, and a weapons and ammunition depot.\n\u201CThis hampers efforts to combat terrorism and proves once again that this coalition lacks seriousness and credibility to effectively fight terrorism,\u201D said the letter, which was published in Syrian state media. The government refers to all those fighting to overthrow President Bashar Assad as \u201Cterrorists.\u201D\nIt was the first time Syria has accused the U.S.-led coalition of hitting its troops.\nThe U.S. denied the claim, saying four alliance airstrikes in the eastern province of Deir el-Zour all hit oil wells about 55 kilometres (34 miles) southeast of where the Syrian government said its camp was struck.\n\u201CWe did not strike any vehicles or personnel targets in this area. We have no indication any Syrian soldiers were even near our strikes,\u201D the coalition statement said, adding that it takes allegations of potential collateral damage seriously and investigates them.\nMoreover, a U.S. military official said Washington was \u201Ccertain\u201D it was a Russian airstrike that hit the camp.\nU.S. officials cited coalition surveillance and other data they said showed that Russian aircraft launched airstrikes near the Syrian army camp. One senior official said the Russian aircraft were in the air around 9 p.m. Sunday near the city of Deir el-Zour, whereas the coalition aircraft were flying an hour earlier about 55 kilometres away.\nA senior U.S. official said radar tracked a dozen Russian TU-22 bombers that left Mozdok, Russia, travelled over the Caspian Sea, across portions of Iran and Iraq, and launched airstrikes in Raqqa, Deir el-Zour and Al Bukamal, Syria.\nRadar shows Russian bombers making seven passes over the city of Deir el-Zour dropping munitions, the official said, adding that one of the TU-22s made a pass over the area of the army camp within one minute of the explosion that killed the Syrian troops. Overall, the Russian bombers launched strikes in four locations around Deir el-Zour.\nThe U.S. officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to discuss the matter publicly.\nThere was no immediate comment from Russian Defence Ministry.\nThe U.S. officials said it was likely the Russians mistakenly hit the Syrian government camp. The U.S. military has been widely critical of Russia\u2019s often indiscriminate strikes, saying Moscow routinely uses so-called \u201Cdumb bombs\u201D rather than the precision-guided munitions used by the coalition.\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which relies on activists in Syria, also reported the airstrikes and a similar death toll. The Observatory said the strikes were \u201Cbelieved\u201D to have been carried out by the coalition.\nThe planes hit the camp known as Sa\u2019iqa, the Observatory said, though it gave a slightly different account, saying the camp is near the village of Ayyash in the western countryside of Deir el-Zour.\nA Facebook page used by Islamic State militants to post news said several coalition warplanes flew over IS positions about 8:30 p.m. Sunday, then headed toward areas controlled by the Syrian government and struck an arms depot in the village of Ayyash, west of Deir el-Zour. Several strong explosions were heard, it said.\nThe city of Deir el-Zour is mainly held by the Islamic State group, but the Syrian government maintains a presence in some parts of it.\nThe IS-affiliated Aamaq news agency released a video showing wide destruction in a residential neighbourhood in Deir el-Zour, saying it was bombed by Russian warplanes. The video showed a wounded child being carried away and a dead boy was on a stretcher.\nThe video appeared genuine and corresponded to other Associated Press reporting of the events.\nThe U.S.-led coalition has been striking at IS targets in Syria for more than a year, and France and Britain recently began their own airstrikes. Russia is also carrying out airstrikes, in co-ordination with the Damascus government.\nThe Obama administration has repeatedly called on Assad to step down. It has refrained from targeting his forces, fearful of being dragged deeper into the increasingly complex civil war.\nRussia began its campaign Sept. 30, saying its airstrikes are meant to weaken IS and other \u201Cterrorists\u201D in Syria. Syrian troops backed by the Russian bombings have captured areas from IS in recent weeks.\nPresident Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said in Moscow that Russian officials have repeatedly emphasized a co-ordinated effort in Syria against the extremists.\n\u201CAn effective fight against these dangers is only possible on the platform of a united coalition and a full co-ordination of our joint actions,\u201D Peskov told reporters.\u201DWe believe that international terrorism, in particular ISIL, which has effectively occupied a sizeable part of Syria and Iraq, poses an equal threat to all of us, all the nations,\u201D he said.\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said airstrikes in the village of Khan in the northeastern province of Hassakeh killed 26 people, including seven children and four women. It said the strikes were believed to have been carried out by the U.S.-led coalition supporting Kurdish fighters in the province.\nAirstrikes also hit several positions in the extremists\u2019 de facto capital of Raqqa in northern Syria, killing and wounding at least 32 fighters, according to several anti-IS activists. Media controlled by IS accused the Russians of being behind those attacks, saying civilians were killed.\nThe coalition has focused primarily on disrupting the Islamic State group\u2019s oil income, stepping up airstrikes in recent weeks on oil fields and facilities.\nA new analysis by the conflict monitoring group IHS estimated the IS group\u2019s overall monthly revenue in late 2015 to be about $80 million, most of it coming from the collection of taxes in areas under its control in Syria and Iraq.\nThe analysis of open source intelligence, including social media, said about half the revenues comes from taxation and confiscation, while about 43 per cent comes from oil. Drug smuggling, the sale of electricity and donations make up the rest.\n\u201CUnlike al-Qaida, the Islamic State has not been dependent on money from foreign donors, to avoid leaving it vulnerable to their influence,\u201D said Columb Strack, senior analyst at IHS, and lead analyst for the IHS Conflict Monitor.\nIHS said the airstrikes have significantly degraded the group\u2019s refining capacity and ability to transport oil via tanker convoys. It did not elaborate.\nBaldor reported from Washington.

"language"=>"english", "text"=>" \tLONDON -- British lawmakers voted by a wide margin Wednesday to join the international campaign of airstrikes against the Islamic State group in Syria, after Prime Minister David Cameron asserted that bombing the \"medieval monsters\" in their heartland would make Britain safer.\n \tThe 397-223 vote in the House of Commons means Royal Air Force fighter jets -- already operating against IS in Iraq from a base in Cyprus -- could be flying over Syria within hours. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond told Channel 4 news that the strikes would begin \"very quickly ... probably not tonight but it could be tomorrow night.\"\n \tAnti-war protesters outside Parliament booed as they learned the result of the vote. The decision came after an emotional 10 1/2-hour debate in which Cameron said that Britain must strike the militants in their heartland and not \"sit back and wait for them to attack us.\"\n \tOpponents argued that Britain's entry into Syria's crowded airspace would make little difference, and said Cameron's military plan was based on wishful thinking that overlooked the messy reality of the Syrian civil war.\n \tCameron has long wanted to target IS in Syria, but had been unsure of getting majority support in the House of Commons until now. He suffered an embarrassing defeat in 2013 when lawmakers rejected a motion backing attacks on the forces of Syrian President Bashar Assad.\n \tThe mood has changed following the Nov. 13 Paris attacks, claimed by IS, that killed 130 people. Both France and the U.S. have urged Britain to join their air campaign in Syria, and Cameron said Britain should not let its allies down.\n \tHe said Britain was already a top target for IS attacks, and airstrikes would reduce the group's ability to plan more Paris-style carnage.\n \t\"Do we work with our allies to degrade and destroy this threat and do we go after these terrorists in their heartlands, from where they are plotting to kill British people?\" he said. \"Or do we sit back and wait for them to attack us?\"\n \tHe said that attacking IS was not anti-Muslim but \"a defence of Islam\" against \"women-raping, Muslim-murdering, medieval monsters.\"\n \tCameron was backed by most members of his governing Conservative Party -- which holds 330 of the 650 Commons seats -- as well as members of the smaller Liberal Democrat party and others.\n \tLabour, the main opposition, was divided. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn -- who represents the left wing of the party -- spoke against what he called a \"reckless and half-baked intervention.\" But more than 60 Labour lawmakers, including senior party figures, voted in support of airstrikes, a move likely to make fissures between the right and the left of the party even worse.\n \tLabour foreign affairs spokesman Hilary Benn said Britain could not \"walk by on the other side of the road\" when international allies were asking for help against IS \"fascists.\"\n \tBritain already conducts airstrikes against IS targets in Iraq, and in August launched a drone strike that killed two British IS militants in Syria.\n \tBritish officials say Royal Air Force Typhoon and Tornado fighter jets, armed with Brimstone missiles capable of hitting moving targets, would bring the campaign highly accurate firepower and help minimize civilian casualties.\n \tPresident Barack Obama welcomed the British vote to join the air campaign in Syria, saying the Islamic State group \"is a global threat that must be defeated by a global response.\"\n \tCritics claim British airstrikes will make little practical difference, and that ground forces will be needed to root out IS. Britain has ruled out sending troops, and critics of the government have responded with skepticism to Cameron's claim that there are 70,000 moderate Syrian rebels on the ground.\n \tCameron stood by that claim Wednesday, though he conceded, \"I'm not saying that the 70,000 are our ideal partners.\"\n \tKarin von Hippel, who was chief of staff to U.S. Gen. John Allen when he was the United States' anti-ISIS envoy, said force alone would not defeat the militants -- but neither would diplomacy by itself.\n \t\"The Brits have expertise and capabilities,\" she said. Their involvement \"brings moral authority and legitimacy to the fight.\"\n \tThe British vote came as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said NATO members were ready to step up military efforts against the Islamic State group -- and held out hope of improved co-operation between the West and Russia to end Syria's four-year civil war.\n \tA day after U.S. Defence Secretary Ash Carter said the United States would deploy a new special operations force to Iraq to step up the fight against the militants, Kerry said other countries could provide assistance that did not involve combat. He said the effort to expand operations would require more medical facilities, intelligence-gathering, military support structure, refuelling operations, aerial defences and other action.\n \tThe German Cabinet has approved plans to commit up to 1,200 soldiers to support the anti-IS coalition in Syria, though not in a combat role.\n \tDespite talk of increased international co-operation, tension has soared between Russia and Turkey after the shooting down of a Russian military jet by Turkish forces last week.\n \tOn Wednesday, Russia's deputy defence minister, Anatoly Antonov, accused Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his family of benefiting from illegal oil trade with Islamic State militants.\n \tErdogan called the claim \"slander\" and said Turkey would not \"buy oil from a terror organization.\"\n \tRussia and the United States also disagree about tactics in Syria, with Moscow backing Assad and Washington saying he must go.\n \tBut Kerry, speaking after NATO meetings in Brussels, said that if Russia's focus on fighting IS was \"genuine,\" it could have a constructive role in bringing peace. He didn't say whether the U.S. might be willing to bring Russia into its military effort against the group, as some members such as France have proposed.\n \tThe top NATO commander in Europe, U.S. Air Force Gen. Philip Breedlove, said the bulk of Russia's air operations in Syria are still directed against moderate anti-Assad opposition forces, not Islamic State positions.\n \tU.S. officials had hoped Russia would change its bombing focus after the Oct. 31 attack on a Russian airliner over Egypt, which killed 224 people.\n \tAsserting that the \"vast majority\" of Russian sorties targeted moderate groups, Breedlove said coalition forces were \"not working with or co-operating with Russia in Syria\" but had devised safety routines to make it easier for both groups.\n \tThe British debate was sometimes bad-tempered as opposition lawmakers demanded Cameron apologize for remarks, reportedly made at a closed-door meeting, in which he branded opponents a \"bunch of terrorist sympathizers.\"\n \tCameron did not retract the comments but said \"there's honour in voting for, there's honour in voting against\" the motion to back airstrikes.\n \tFrom the passionate speeches in the House to the anti-war protesters outside Parliament, the debate recalled Britain's divisive 2003 decision to join the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq on what turned out to be false claims about Saddam Hussein's alleged weapons of mass destruction. Many lawmakers came to regret supporting the war and ensuing chaos, and blamed then-Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair for lacking a plan for post-war reconstruction.\n \tLabour leader Corbyn said that \"to oppose another reckless and half-baked intervention isn't pacifism. It's hard-headed common sense.\"\n \tLabour's Shabana Mahmood -- one of the few Muslim lawmakers in Parliament -- called IS \"Nazi-esque totalitarians who are outlaws from Islam,\" but said she opposed the strikes because \"we cannot simply bomb the ground, we have to have a strategy to hold it as well.\"\n \tBut Cameron said doing nothing was a worse option.\n \t\"The risks of inaction are greater than the risks of what I propose,\" he said.\n \tAssociated Press writers Gregory Katz in London, Suzan Frazer in Ankara, Deb Riechmann in Washington, Jamey Keaten in Brussels and Sinan Salaheddin in Baghdad contributed to this report.\n", "docSentiment"=>{"mixed"=>"1", "score"=>"-0.426683", "type"=>"negative"}} @url=#<URI::HTTPS:0xa339f14 URL:https://gateway-a.watsonplatform.net/calls/url/URLGetTextSentiment?apikey=bc9d67cc85047b79b30187500483a6212581839d&outputMode=json&showSourceText=1&sourceText=cleaned&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ctvnews.ca%2Fworld%2Fbritish-mps-approve-airstrikes-on-islamic-state-targets-in-syria-1.2682906> @request=#<Faraday::RequestOptions (empty)> @request_headers={"Accept-Encoding"=>"none", "User-Agent"=>"Faraday v0.9.2"} @ssl=#<Faraday::SSLOptions verify=true> @response=#<Faraday::Response:0xa326680 ...> @response_headers={"server"=>"nginx", "date"=>"Sat, 12 Dec 2015 19:29:04 GMT", "content-type"=>"application/json", "content-length"=>"8758", "connection"=>"close", "cache-control"=>"no-cache", "x-alchemyapi-currentversion"=>"12.23a", "x-alchemyapi-key"=>"bc9d67cc85047b79b30187500483a6212581839d", "x-alchemyapi-params"=>"sentiment=0&knowledgeGraph=0&detectedLanguage=english&submitLanguage=detect", "x-alchemyapi-raw-content-size"=>"194114", "x-alchemyapi-requested-url"=>"http://www.ctvnews.ca/world/british-mps-approve-airstrikes-on-islamic-state-targets-in-syria-1.2682906", "x-alchemyapi-retrieved-url"=>"http://www.ctvnews.ca/world/british-mps-approve-airstrikes-on-islamic-state-targets-in-syria-1.2682906", "x-alchemyapi-status"=>"OK", "x-alchemyapi-text-content-size"=>"8115", "x-alchemyapi-total-transactions"=>"1", "access-control-allow-origin"=>"*"} @status=200>>, #<Faraday::Response:0xa2ffbac @on_complete_callbacks=[], @env=#<Faraday::Env @method=:get @body={"status"=>"OK", "usage"=>"By accessing AlchemyAPI or using information generated by AlchemyAPI, you are agreeing to be bound by the AlchemyAPI Terms of Use: http://www.alchemyapi.com/company/terms.html", "url"=>"http://www.ctvnews.ca/world/british-airstrikes-hit-oil-fields-in-eastern-syria-1.2684528", "totalTransactions"=>"1", "language"=>"english", "text"=>" \tLONDON -- British Tornado jets struck oil fields in eastern Syria on Thursday that help finance the Islamic State group and Germany prepared to send reconnaissance aircraft to the Middle East as coalition forces stepped up efforts to fight the militants.\n \tThe strikes at the Omar oil field came hours after Britain's Parliament authorized military action in Syria against the extremists. Although several of the oil fields have already been hit by the U.S.-led coalition, Britain chose a target with low risk of collateral damage for its first strike in Syria.\n \t\"This strikes a very real blow at the oil and the revenue on which the Daesh terrorists depend,\" Defence Secretary Michael Fallon told the BBC, using the Arabic acronym for IS.\n \tRussian President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, called for \"one powerful fist\" in the global fight against the Islamic State group, following the downing of a Russian jetliner over Egypt and last month's attacks in Paris, both claimed by the extremist group.\n \tSpeaking in his state-of-the-nation address, Putin accused Washington and its allies of turning Iraq, Syria and Libya into a \"zone of chaos and anarchy threatening the entire world\" by supporting change of regimes in those countries.\n \t\"We must leave all arguments and disagreements behind and make one powerful fist, a single anti-terror front, which would work on the basis of international law under the aegis of the United Nations,\" Putin said, addressing lawmakers and top officials gathered in an ornate Kremlin hall.\n \tThe efforts to forge unity gained momentum as Fallon confirmed that eight more jets were on their way to Britain's base in Cyprus to join the attacks and warned that military action against IS could continue for years, not months.\n \tOther allies also moved to get equipment into place. Germany's government said it planned to send up to six Tornado reconnaissance planes, tanker aircraft and a frigate to help protect the French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle in the eastern Mediterranean, but won't actively engage in combat.\n \tIn all, up to 1,200 German soldiers would be deployed to support the international coalition fighting the Islamic State group. Two Tornados and a tanker could be sent to Turkey's Incirlik air base next week if the German Parliament approves the mission Friday as expected.\n \tThe bulk of German troops and planes likely won't arrive in the region until next month.\n \tGerman Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen said the mission would have three components: to protect French naval operations, to provide intelligence though reconnaissance aircraft and satellite observation, and to offer logistical support like in-air refuelling for allied planes.\n \t\"The goal... is to fight and contain IS, and destroy their safe havens and their ability to lead worldwide terror operations,\" she told reporters in Berlin before heading to Ankara for talks with her Turkish counterpart.\n \tFrance welcomed the first British airstrikes in Syria, saying they are a sign of the European solidarity promised after the deadly Nov. 13 attacks on Paris claimed by IS militants.\n \tIn a statement Thursday, French President Francois Hollande said the British Parliament's approval of the airstrikes and the upcoming German vote were a sign that Europeans would stand together after the IS attacks that killed 130 people and left hundreds wounded in Paris.\n \tFrench fighter jets joined the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State extremists in Iraq in 2014 and expanded their mission to IS targets in Syria in September.\n \tOther European officials also appealed for a joint global response. Diplomats at an Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe conference in Belgrade said Thursday that only a unified front could be effective in countering the threat of terrorism.\n \tGerman Foreign Minister Frank Walter Steinmeier described the situation as \"too dangerous, and freedom and stability too fragile, for us to counter each other\" -- an apparent reference to the spat caused by the downing of a Russian plane by Turkey. Foreign ministers from the two countries were to meet in Belgrade later Thursday for the first time since the incident.\n \tBut international cohesion remained elusive. Putin again accused Turkey profiting from oil trade with IS -- allegations Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has strongly denied.\n \t\"We know who in Turkey are filling their pockets and allowing terrorists to earn money by selling oil stolen from Syria,\" Putin said in his state of the union address.\n \t\"For that money the bandits are recruiting mercenaries, buying weapons and staging cruel terror attacks aimed against our citizens, as well as citizens of France, Lebanon, Mali and other countries,\" he said.\n \tRussian troops have moved to fortify their positions in Syria expanding a military base, adding fortifications and developing its runways in a sign they intend to use it as their second air base in the country, Syrian activists said Thursday.\n \tThe work underway at the Shaayrat air base, about 40 kilometres southeast of the city of Homs, could also signal Moscow's intention to step up airstrikes in the country's central region where the Islamic State group is active.\n \tAssociated Press writers Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow, Bassem Mroue in Beirut, Jovana Gec in Belgrade, David Rising in Berlin and Menelaos Hadjicostis in Akrotiri, Cyprus, contributed to this report.\nTwo British Tornados warplanes fly over the RAF Akrotiri, a British air base near coastal city of Limassol, Cyprus as they arrive from an airstrike against ISIS, Thursday, Dec. 3, 2015.

Crews at one U.K.\u00A0base are reportedly\u00A0scrambling to get two more Tornados ready to send out, increasing the number of missions British pilots can fly over Syria daily.\nAnti-war protesters outside Parliament booed as they learned the result of the vote. The decision came after an emotional 10 \u00BD-hour debate in which Cameron said that Britain must strike the Islamic State group in their heartland and not \"sit back and wait for them to attack us.\"\nOpponents argued that Britain's entry into Syria's crowded airspace would make little difference, and said Cameron's military plan was based on wishful thinking that overlooked the messy reality of the Syrian civil war.\nCameron has long wanted to target ISIS in Syria, but had been unsure of getting majority support in the House of Commons until now. He suffered an embarrassing defeat in 2013 when lawmakers rejected a motion backing attacks on the forces of Syrian President Bashar Assad.\nParis attacks hit close to home for Britons\nThe mood has changed following the Nov. 13 Paris attacks, claimed by ISIS, that killed 130 people. Both France and the U.S. have urged Britain to join their air campaign in Syria, and Cameron said Britain should not let its allies down.\nMany\u00A0Britons are supportive of the decision, seeing the\u00A0Paris attacks\u00A0as a\u00A0reminder that London could be targeted.\u00A0\nCameron said Britain was already a top target for ISIS attacks, and airstrikes would reduce the group's ability to plan more Paris-style carnage.\n\"Do we work with our allies to degrade and destroy this threat and do we go after these terrorists in their heartlands, from where they are plotting to kill British people?\" he said. \"Or do we sit back and wait for them to attack us?\"\nHe said that attacking ISIS was not anti-Muslim but \"a defence of Islam\" against \"women-raping, Muslim-murdering, medieval monsters.\"\nThe British contribution forms only a tiny part of U.S.-led \"Operation Inherent Resolve,\" which has been bombing ISIS targets in Iraq and Syria for more than a year with hundreds of aircraft. Previously, the small British contingent participated in strikes on Iraq but not Syria.\nThe strikes have so far failed to dislodge the militants from a swath of territory where they have proclaimed a Caliphate to rule over all Muslims, although Washington and its allies say they have helped halt the fighters' advance.\nWashington has announced it will deploy more special forces to conduct raids in both Iraq and Syria and help locate targets for air strikes.\nU.S. President Barack Obama said in an interview this did not mean a large scale ground assault like the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq \"with battalions that are moving across the desert.\"\n\"But what I've been very clear about is that we are going to systematically squeeze and ultimately destroy ISIL and that requires us having a military component to that,\" he told CBS.\n  \"We are going to systematically squeeze and ultimately destroy ISIL and that requires us having a military component.\"  - U.S. President Barack Obama \nMost of the world's powers are now flying combat missions over Iraq and Syria against Islamic State. But any consensus on how to proceed has been thwarted by opposing policies over the four-year-old civil war in Syria, which has killed 250,000 people, driven 11 million from their homes, left swaths of territory in the hands of jihadist fighters and defied all diplomatic efforts at a solution.\nRussia is bombing Syria outside the U.S.-led coalition. Moscow and Tehran support Assad, while the United States and its European, Arab and Turkish allies want him gone and back his enemies.\nAfter the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for both the attacks on Paris and the bombing of a Russian airliner last month, world leaders have striven to bury differences and unite the separate campaigns against the militants.\nBut the quest for unity was dealt a sharp blow last week when NATO-member Turkey shot down a Russian warplane.\n\"It appears that Allah decided to punish the ruling clique of Turkey by depriving them of wisdom and judgment,\" Vladimir Putin said Thursday during the Russian president's annual state of the nation speech.\nMoscow has already responded with measures including bans on some Turkish fruit and vegetables, and in his icy remarks, Putin made clear that would not be the end of it.\n\"If anyone thinks that having committed this awful war crime, the murder of our people, that they are going to get away with some measures concerning their tomatoes or some limits on construction and other sectors, they are sorely mistaken.\"\nTurkey would have cause to regret its actions \"more than once,\" Putin said. Minutes after the speech, his energy minister announced the suspension of a gas pipeline project.\nRussian and Turkish foreign ministers met in Belgrade on Thursday in the first high-level face-to-face contact since the plane was shot down, but the two sides still appeared far apart.\nRussia's Sergei Lavrov said he had heard nothing new from Mevlut Cavusoglu.
