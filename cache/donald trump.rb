They\u2019re losing ground to absurd figures who used to be jokes, rabble-rousers, fringe players on the margins of political life. Who would have thought, a year ago, that serious people would be in such a panic over how to stop the likes of Marine Le Pen and Donald Trump?\nOver here, the appalling vulgarian has sucked up all the airtime, like some particularly virulent black hole. The more outrageous he gets, the higher his ratings soar. Mr. Trump degrades political debate. He poses a mortal threat to the Republican Party, which he airily dismisses as a gang of idiots. But they have no idea how to stop him.\nOver there, Ms. Le Pen and her ravishing young niece, Marion Mar\u00E9chal-Le Pen, have trampled the mainstream parties under their chic high heels. Last week their far-right anti-immigration, anti-Europe party, the National Front, won nearly 30 per cent of the vote in the first round of regional elections. Reaction in Europe ranged from fear to panic to outright horror. \u201CFrance\u2019s fascist uprising,\u201D blared Britain\u2019s Independent. Political columnist Fran\u00E7oise Fressoz wrote, \u201CThe political reality in France can now be summed up in one question. Who can stop Marine Le Pen?\u201D\nThe source of their appeal isn\u2019t hard to find. In both countries, the dominant political class has failed miserably to understand and address the anxieties of large numbers of middle-class people.\n\u201CDonald Trump says things no one else dares to say,\u201D his fans tell you. When he said the U.S. should deport its millions of illegal Mexican immigrants, they cheered. When he said Muslims should be banned from immigrating, the political and media class expressed universal horror. But in the fevered wake of the San Bernardino slaughter, many people thought: Why not? When a recent poll asked respondents if the values of Islam are incompatible with the American way of life, 76 per cent of Republicans answered yes. And 43 per cent of Democrats also answered yes.\nThat\u2019s the genius of Trumpism. There\u2019s Donald Trump \u2013 and then there\u2019s everybody else, yelling that he can\u2019t say that. That\u2019s why he\u2019s the Republican front-runner.\nPopulists come up with simplistic answers to complex questions \u2013 questions the elites would prefer not to address. Mr. Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant stance is purely opportunistic. But the utter failure of both Republicans and Democrats to tackle immigration reform in any meaningful way has left the field wide open.\nIt\u2019s the same with Marine Le Pen. People take to her because she stands up for ordinary folks \u2013 especially the rural and small-town folks, the young and unemployed folks, the folks who\u2019ve been hit hard by massive deindustrialization. Unlike Mr. Trump, she\u2019s not a flame-thrower. She comes across as moderate and reasoned. She\u2019s worked hard to scrub the party clean of its overtly racist past. But she, too, has been able to capitalize on the the mainstream parties\u2019 widespread failure to tackle France\u2019s serious economic and immigration woes.\nIt\u2019s fashionable to write off the people who respond to Mr. Trump and Ms. Le Pen as ignorant lowbrows, who can\u2019t adjust to modernity, to progress and to newcomers. That has been the standard response of the pundits and political elites. And that is a big part of the problem. The triumph of two of them has less to do with the baser instincts of the voters than with the incompetence of the current leadership. \u201C[Le Pen\u2019s] success is due to the failures and vacuum of the centre right, the weak conservatism of the Socialist Party, and the inability of the EU to respond to serious European challenges,\u201D The New York Times\u2019s Steven Erlanger told Carnegie Europe. Similarly, Mr. Trump\u2019s success is in large part due to the Republicans\u2019 inability to craft an appealing alternative to the Democrats. In both countries, many people don\u2019t see much difference among the old ruling parties. They\u2019re all part of the same old gang, and only a new outsider can bust them up.\nBoth Mr. Trump and Ms. LePen have profited hugely from the shock of domestic terrorism. But the unease they feed on is much deeper than that. \u201CThis sense of fury has a long history,\u201D wrote Alexis Brezet, editor of Le Figaro. \u201CIt is a cold, brutal, unsubtle, merciless fury. It has been brewed by 30 years of state weakness and government failures.\u201D People feel the values they hold dear are slipping away. Mr. Trump and Ms. Le Pen are promising to bring them back again.\nHow far will they go? My guess: The Republicans will rally round another champion and Donald Trump will probably be gone by March. (Whether he\u2019ll decide to run as an independent is anybody\u2019s guess. Hillary Clinton can only hope so.) Marine Le Pen won\u2019t go the distance either. Even so, their profound challenges to the old order aren\u2019t going to go away. If our mainstream parties can\u2019t rise to them, then someone else will.\n", :normalized_score_absolute=>27.702099999999994, :normalized_score_relative=>0.0}, {:title=>"Pete McMartin: The towering and selective outrage against Donald Trump", :url=>"http://www.vancouversun.com/opinion/columnists/pete+mcmartin+towering+selective+outrage+against/11583832/story.html", :source=>"The Vancouver Sun", :score=>-0.394827, :type=>"negative", :content=>"Last June, Donald Trump kicked off his presidential campaign by slandering an entire nation. It was business as usual.\n\u201CWhat can be simpler or more accurately stated?\u201D Trump asked his audience. His answer, as always, was simple but not necessarily accurate.\n\u201CThe Mexican government is forcing their most unwanted people into the United States. They are, in many cases, criminals, drug dealers, rapists, etc.\u201D\nHow many were criminals, drug dealers and rapists? Trump didn\u2019t say, and didn\u2019t have to. He\u2019s not a details guy. He paints his canvas with the broad brush.\nBut consider: There are 54 million Latinos in the U.S., the largest minority group in that nation, and many of them vote. Seventy-five per cent of them voted Democrat in the last election.\nThat Trump was willing to alienate not only Mexico but, by association, the 54 million Latinos living in the U.S. \u2014 on the first day of his campaign \u2014 suggests either he knew exactly what he was doing or he was some kind of batshit crazy, though the distinction between the two may be so narrow in Trump\u2019s case they might each be considered one half of the whole.\nHis sound bite got the attention but the meat in his speech came further on, when he called for the deportation of 11 million illegal Latino immigrants plus their American-born children. Then he promised to build a wall along the entire Mexican border to keep them out, while demanding \u2014 and this is true chutzpah \u2014 Mexico contribute to the cost of building it.\n(None of which, by the way, is a new idea or reality. In the 1930s and 1940s, an estimated two million Mexican immigrants, half of them legal U.S. citizens, were \u201Crepatriated\u201D to Mexico without due process, for fear they were taking jobs from whites. Some were forced out, some fled for fear of violence. Most never returned.)\nOutrage ensued. Pundits predicted Trump\u2019s early exit. But rather than tank, Trump ascended. The hubbub didn\u2019t end his campaign: it fuelled it. He\u2019s since ruled the polls, and monopolized the campaign conversation, mostly because he\u2019s really the only interesting candidate in it. He\u2019s not afraid to say in public what people aren\u2019t afraid to say in the privacy of their own homes.\nRacist, xenophobe, fascist: Trump has been called all those things. But there is no denying his message resonated with many Americans who believed the U.S. had lost control of its borders, and who believed \u2014 rightly, I would say \u2014 the immigration process had been subverted by millions of illegals.\nAnd before we get all righteous on America, as we are wont to do, I would suggest that Trump\u2019s immigration message would find a large and willing audience right here in Vancouver, considering the virulence of our housing debate.\nI met and interviewed Trump in 2013 when he announced the deal that would put his name on Vancouver\u2019s own Trump tower. So when he dropped the Latino bomb I called the building\u2019s owners, Holborn Holdings Ltd., to ask if they considered renaming the building.\nI wasn\u2019t suggesting they should \u2014 I couldn't have cared less. What they called their building was their business and no one else\u2019s. It still is.\nBut I thought at the time there would be a public outcry against Trump here, given his visit to Vancouver.\nI was wrong. No one seemed to care. As much as I have been able to tell, no one in government or in the public that I could find at the time went on record demanding that the Trump tower name be changed.\nBut this week, after Trump\u2019s call to close the borders to all Muslims \u201Cuntil,\u201D to quote Trump, \u201Cour country\u2019s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on,\u201D a former city planner and a city councillor have both called for a name change to the building, and not one but two petitions have been circulated calling for the same. One of those petitions encourages the mayor and city council to \u201Cforce\u201D the developers to change the name. All of it has been widely covered in the media.\nHow weirdly selective that is, and oh, how politically correct. The call to ban Muslim immigrants \u2014 whose numbers in the U.S. don\u2019t even rank in the top 10 among subgroups \u2014 causes widespread condemnation here and calls to action.\nBut the forceful ejection of 11 million Latinos and their children? The baseless insults to a U.S. minority group whose numbers dwarf the entire population of Canada?\nNo wonder Trump sneers at his detractors and the media. He, at least, stays on message, however ugly that message may be.\nAnd while we act as if he was some kind of buffoon whose demagogy was a temporary aberration, who we think could be brought low by a name change to a highrise when it would do exactly the opposite, we fail to ask the real question Trump poses, namely: Why do so many people like what he has to say?\n", :normalized_score_absolute=>30.25865, :normalized_score_relative=>6.073734660754793}, {:title=>"Trump\u2019s true believers: How he\u2019s gone farther than Europe\u2019s far right, and who got him there", :url=>"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/how-trump-has-gone-farther-than-europes-far-right-and-who-got-himthere/article27713704/", :source=>"Globe and Mail", :score=>-0.369463, :type=>"negative", :content=>"  Donald Trump, Dec. 7 \n On Monday night, the Republican Party was thrust off the edge of the political map into uncharted terrain, its leaders forced into the sort of moral crisis no American party has faced for decades. Its most popular presidential hopeful had gone far beyond the bounds of acceptable politics, core American values and basic human decency, by making a serious proposal to exclude an entire category of people from the United States based on their religious and ethnic\u00A0identity. \n The politics of racial exclusion, long banished from mainstream North American politics, had burst into the forefront of one of the world\u2019s largest and most influential political\u00A0parties. \n By Tuesday afternoon, it had become a problem for the entire United States. It was clear that Donald Trump\u2019s proposal to forbid people who identify themselves as Muslim from entering the United States, while quickly condemned by most politicians of the left, centre and right, had actually increased his popularity among Republican voters. A Bloomberg poll, taken on Tuesday, showed that of those who are likely to vote in the 2016 Republican primaries, 35 per cent approve of his proposal, and a similar number say they are therefore \u201Cmore likely to vote for\u00A0him.\u201D \n As pollster Frank Luntz, looking at similar numbers, concluded on Wednesday, \u201CYou actually have to consider the possibility of Trump winning the Republican nomination\u201D \u2013 that is, if the party is unable to expel or marginalize him, something its leaders were wary of considering this\u00A0week. \n The United States is discovering, very quickly, that a charismatic single-issue candidate whose single issue is bigotry and intolerance can attract significant support, and possibly even seize control of a major\u00A0party. \n True, Republican candidates have certainly used racially divisive language and trafficked in conspiracy theories about Latinos and Muslims. In the 2012 primaries, at least three candidates repeated a conspiracy theory about a secret plot by ordinary Muslim Americans to impose Sharia law by stealth. And this year, some of Mr. Trump\u2019s competitors have offered less radical versions of his fearmongering (such as denying citizenship to undocumented Latinos, or accepting only those Syrian refugees who are\u00A0Christian). \n But no mainstream candidate in recent history has used discrimination and racial fear not as a means to power but as an end in itself, as a chief policy\u00A0goal. \n In other words, Americans have learned that they have something in common with most countries in Europe, where a third-place opposition party devoted almost entirely to opposing racial and religious minorities has become a growing\u00A0fixture. \n Mr. Trump\u2019s rise to political fame, his positions, his public style, his singular focus on immigration and ethnicity and, most importantly, his supporters are strikingly similar to those of Europe\u2019s latest extreme-right firebrands: Marine Le Pen of France\u2019s National Front, Nigel Farage of Britain\u2019s UK Independence Party, Jimmie Akesson of the Sweden Democrats, Heinz-Christian Strache of Austria\u2019s Freedom Party and Geert Wilders of PVV in the Netherlands (who heartily endorsed the Muslim-banning proposal of his near-lookalike Mr.\u00A0Trump). \n Most of these parties have been slowly growing in size and popularity as the big social-democratic and Christian-democratic parties have withered, and while their supporters are nowhere near a majority in any country, in some places \u2013 notably Austria and France \u2013 they are edging into second-place\u00A0territory. \n Mr. Trump has plunged his country deep into this terrain, while simultaneously going further, with his Monday announcement, than almost any of these leaders\u00A0have. \n \u201CThe most amazing thing about Trump\u2019s latest statement, of not allowing any Muslims in, was that almost none of the European far-right parties would go that far,\u201D says Cas Mudde, a Dutch political scientist at the University of Georgia who analyzes anti-immigration political movements. \u201CThe only other party leader who\u2019s ever said that was Geert Wilders. I mean, Marine Le Pen hasn\u2019t made such statements, Strache hasn\u2019t \u2013 they\u2019ve always separated Islamism from Muslims. Trump went, within two months, from being a little bit critical of Islam to being among the most Islamophobic politicians in the\u00A0world.\u201D \n This poses two big challenges. One is for the Republican Party, which now faces an existential crisis. And one is for the wider U.S. political system, which needs to figure out how a large proportion of voters \u2013 possibly 15 or 20 per cent \u2013 became so angry and alienated that they would support the darkest form of intolerance, and whether it can find a way to direct those voters\u2019 anxieties into more moderate\u00A0politics. \n Both challenges rely on a key question: Just who are these people supporting Donald\u00A0Trump? \n THE DAWN OF THE\u00A0DISAFFECTEDS \n There is a genuine fear within Republican leadership and activist groups that Mr. Trump is going to tear the party in two. For he seems to have awakened a new group of voters whose aspirations are radically different from those of the Republican Party\u2019s traditional right\u00A0wing. \n \u201CThe phenomenon is real, and the danger Trump presents for the Republican Party is real,\u201D writes Ben Domenech, a Republican activist, publisher and former speechwriter in the administration of George W. Bush. \u201CHis statements have tapped into a widespread anger that has the potential to transform the Republican Party in significant ways. Ultimately, Trump presents a choice for the Republican Party about which path to follow: a path toward a coalition that is broad, classically liberal, and consistent with the party\u2019s history, or a path toward a coalition that is reduced to the narrow interests of identity politics for white\u00A0people.\u201D \n That shift toward \u201Cidentity politics for white people\u201D has created a new kind of Republican\u00A0voter. \n During the summer, it was commonplace for Republican activists, columnists and insiders to say that Mr. Trump\u2019s support would vanish come primary time: The people who were supporting him did not seem to be Republican voters. In fact, the people supporting him didn\u2019t seem to be coming from anywhere the party\u00A0recognized. \n An ABC News/Washington Post poll in late July found that Mr. Trump\u2019s strongest support came from \u201Cpeople at the margins of the Republican primary\u00A0process.\u201D \n Notably, it found that his support is four times higher among those with no postsecondary education (32 per cent of whom support him) than it is among university graduates. Polling at the end of November showed similar results, with Mr. Trump the favoured choice among voters without college degrees by a two-to-one margin over other\u00A0candidates. \n Equally surprising: On issues other than race and ethnicity, Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters don\u2019t tend to be especially right-wing. The ABC/Washington Post poll found that among very conservative voters, 17 per cent supported Mr. Trump; among somewhat conservative voters, 24 per cent did; and among moderate-to-liberal voters, 27 per cent\u00A0did. \n Republican activists have frequently noted that the core Trump supporters aren\u2019t coming from the GOP base; rather, they\u2019re part of a \u201Cwild card\u201D constituency, often alienated from mainstream politics, that votes Democratic or Republican \u2013 or, often, not at all. In its mammoth breakdown of American voting blocs, the Pew Research Center finds the group most likely to vote Trump is the community that it has variously labelled the \u201CDisaffecteds\u201D or, more recently, \u201CHard-Pressed\u00A0Skeptics.\u201D \n This group, representing between 9 and 13 per cent of the U.S. electorate, tends to be male (twice as many men as women today back Mr. Trump\u2019s politics), overwhelmingly white, and especially lacking in education: 7 in 10 of them have no postsecondary education, compared to 49 per cent\u00A0nationwide. \n As Pew\u2019s original, 2005 definition of the group read: \u201CDisaffecteds are only moderate supporters of government welfare and assistance to the poor. Strongly oppose immigration as well as regulatory and environmental policies on the grounds that government is ineffective and such measures cost jobs.\u201D Eighty per cent of them said immigrants \u201Care a burden on our country\u201D nearly double the rate of the general American\u00A0public. \n They don\u2019t tend to be staunch partisans: In 2005, 68 per cent of the disaffected group were registered Independents, and only 32 per cent were Republican. They tended to vote for Mr. Bush over John Kerry in 2004, then for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. By 2014, this group, defined slightly differently, was half Democratic and 37-per-cent Republican. Now they\u2019ve been captured by Mr.\u00A0Trump. \n Indeed, some observers say that the surprisingly strong turnout for overtly socialist Democratic Party candidate Bernie Sanders is coming from exactly the same constituency that\u2019s backing Mr. Trump. As the conservative writer Yuval Levin wrote in the National Review, \u201CBoth Trump and Sanders are calling attention to those political debates in which the inherent cosmopolitanism of modern capitalism is most deeply in tension with the inherent populism of modern democracy \u2013 especially, but by no means exclusively, immigration and\u00A0trade.\u201D \n It is perhaps easiest to understand the Disaffecteds as a case of failed integration. As the children and grandchildren of the old postwar U.S. white industrial working class, they have followed a trajectory, and fallen into ways of thinking, that are strikingly similar to those of some unsuccessful low-income immigrant groups in Europe: a low educational-attainment rate, lack of entrepreneurial success, reverse social mobility across generations, a tendency to self-segregate into ethnic enclaves and self-policed neighbourhoods, and, now, an increasing tendency to vote for extremist politics. They have not literally immigrated into America but rather have landed in a postindustrial, cosmopolitan economy, and resisted any effort to assimilate, instead choosing to turn against more successfully integrated American\u00A0newcomers. \n This alienated, white, generally male, older and undereducated constituency \u2013 perhaps 10 to 15 per cent of voters \u2013 has been driving the rise of new parties of the anti-minority right across the Western\u00A0world. \n Matthew Goodwin, a political scientist with Britain\u2019s Chatham House, has been analyzing the views and attitudes of people voting for anti-immigration parties across Europe and the United States. He says Mr. Trump\u2019s voters are strikingly similar to those backing far-right parties in the Netherlands, Britain or\u00A0Austria. \n \u201CWhat\u2019s most important is the role of anxiety, nostalgia and fears of cultural change among white Americans \u2013 especially white Americans who have not gone to university and have felt financially cut adrift from the transformation of their economy and have felt under threat from rapidly rising rates of ethnic diversity,\u201D Mr. Goodwin says. \u201CFor these people, this identity politics has become more influential than traditional issues such as jobs and\u00A0housing.\u201D \n Those voters didn\u2019t so much walk away from mainstream politics as find themselves abandoned by it. The big parties of the centre-left and the centre-right saw educated elites as their crucial constituency, and aimed for aspirational groups such as young university graduates and suburban soccer moms, who increasingly drove election outcomes. The lost low-education white voters simmered in the\u00A0background. \n Then, in the years after 2001, anti-immigration activists and people peddling anti-Muslim conspiracy theories discovered this\u00A0group. \n \u201CImmigration came up as a salient issue that cuts across that traditional party dividing line, and it became more important to working-class voters than the old left-right ideology,\u201D Dr. Goodwin says. \u201CAnd the parties failed to respond to that quickly enough because they were fixated on middle-class university graduates who were numerous enough that they decided the fate of elections. And the old working class, who used to decide elections in the sixties and seventies, became smaller in size, increasingly disenchanted and open to the appeals of the radical\u00A0right.\u201D \n Donald Trump, after countless false attempts to run for president (he has launched bids in almost every election), finally stumbled upon this group, and its singular obsession with immigrants and minorities, and seemed instinctively to see that they were unclaimed in American politics. Some of them had fallen into the racially intolerant branch of the Tea Party movement; others had stopped voting. His angry appeal to ethnic fear and white identity politics galvanized them, and turned them into what is, at the moment, the Republican Party\u2019s biggest\u00A0problem. \n For Reince Priebus, the former Tea Partier who chairs the Republican National Committee, this is the worst possible nightmare. After the dismal results of the 2012 presidential election, Mr. Priebus, along with most other Republican officials, recognized one of the new realities of U.S. political life: It is almost impossible to win the presidency if your party relies largely on the votes of white people. And in 2012, the Republicans received only 27 per cent of Hispanic votes and 6 per cent of African-American votes, a shortfall that analysts say cost them the\u00A0presidency. \n Mr. Priebus spent much of 2014 trying to raise his party\u2019s appeal to minority voters, boasting that he was spending about $8.5-million a month on outreach efforts. \u201CWhat I\u2019m saying is, instead of getting 6 per cent of the black vote in this country, if we get out there and fight and talk to people, then we get 15, then we get 20, and two years later we get 22 and 23. I\u2019m in this for the long haul,\u201D he said in a television interview last\u00A0year. \n And then along came Donald\u00A0Trump. \n In the wake of the real-estate mogul\u2019s sharp turn against Latin Americans \u2013 with his proposal a year ago to build a wall to keep immigrants out and to deport the 11 million full-time U.S. residents without citizenship \u2013 only 11 per cent of Hispanic Americans now support him. His African-American support was measured at 3 per cent in a recent CNN poll. And that\u2019s just the direct effect of Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy. Republican officials fear that a wider revulsion caused by his foray into the fringes of ethnic-resentment politics will drive larger numbers of people \u2013 notably religious and racial minorities \u2013 away from their\u00A0party. \n An even deeper fear is that Mr. Trump, if successful, will redefine the Republicans as a party built around the politics of racial\u00A0identity. \n There are, as the Republicans have long known, a lot of people who will come out to vote for \u201Cidentity politics for white people.\u201D But not anywhere close to a majority of Americans. The last time overtly racial-identity politics dominated the Republican Party, with the fire-breathing candidacy of Senator Barry Goldwater in 1964, the result was one of the most decisive defeats in presidential-election history, to Lyndon B. Johnson. Now, half a century later, there are a lot more minority voters, racial tolerance is vastly higher, and liberal Democrats are the fastest-growing political\u00A0constituency. \n That new reality was revealed starkly in an NBC-Wall Street Journal poll released on Thursday, which showed that 60 per cent of Americans have a \u201Cvery negative\u201D or \u201Cmostly negative\u201D view of Mr. Trump (and only about 12 per cent were \u201Cvery positive\u201D about him) \u2013 and that almost 65 per cent have a \u201Cvery favourable\u201D or \u201Cmostly favourable\u201D view of Muslims in their\u00A0country. \n The cheeky headline the Washington Post put on the poll, \u201CAmericans like Muslims more than they like Donald Trump,\u201D spells out the difficult decision faced by Mr. Priebus and his\u00A0colleagues. \n If Mr. Trump is allowed to prevail in the primaries, the Republicans\u2019 bid for the presidency is doomed \u2013 as, quite possibly, is the future of their party. But if they persuade him to leave the party or gaslight him out of the race \u2013 neither of which would be easy, as U.S. parties have no ability to oust members, and Mr. Trump is notoriously immune to influence or advice \u2013 then there\u2019s a good chance he will run as an independent, possibly taking his supporters and a good chunk of other Republicans with him. As Ross Perot showed in 1992 and Ralph Nader did in 2000, even a fairly minor third-party candidate can upset a presidential\u00A0race. \n Mr. Priebus dug himself deeper in August, when he forced all the party\u2019s candidates to sign a \u201Cloyalty pledge,\u201D in which they promise to support whichever candidate wins the primaries \u2013 and not to drop out and run a third-party campaign. Mr. Trump eagerly signed: It was intended to keep him from deserting, but it now means that the party is effectively stuck with\u00A0him. \n Faced with this dismal pair of options, the Republican leadership appears to have frozen in terror. When Mr. Priebus finally got around to responding to Mr. Trump\u2019s noxious proposal this week, his words were mild and passive. \u201CI don\u2019t agree,\u201D he said, \u201CWe need to aggressively take on radical Islamic terorrism but not at the expense of our American\u00A0values.\u201D \n And then, nothing. In the face of the greatest threat to its political survival, the party appears to have chosen to bide its time, and hope that Mr. Trump will finally do or say something that will diminish, rather than bolster, his\u00A0popularity. \n Mr. Trump is not going to become President of the United States. That prospect, in any imaginable scenario, would be utterly undone by the very things that make him appeal to a certain angry, ignored, white group of voters. His popularity among these excluded men is exactly what will prevent the much larger, more multihued, more moderate mainstream American electorate from considering him a viable presidential\u00A0candidate. \n But Mr. Trump will have a profound effect on American politics.

Consequently, we are welcoming, but we decide with whom we are welcoming.

I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.

I admire that he's managed to restore pride and contentment to a great nation that's been humiliated and persecuted for 70 years.

I mean, everything I say he agrees with me, no matter what I say,\" Trump began. \"But with the ethanol, really, he's got to come a long way.\"\nHe added: \"If Ted Cruz is against ethanol, how does he win in Iowa? Because that's very anti-Iowa.\"\nTrump also appeared to take a veiled shot at Cruz's family background, suggesting Cruz might have trouble appealing to the state's evangelical voters. \"I do like Ted Cruz, but not a lot of evangelicals come out of Cuba,\" he said of the country where Cruz's father, an evangelical preacher, was born.\nThe attacks came after The New York Times reported that Cruz had questioned Trump's judgment at a closed-door fundraiser, straining the rare detente between two of the race's most outspoken candidates. Trump has gone after his other opponents gleefully and viciously, panning Jeb Bush as low-energy, Ben Carson as \"pathological\" and Marco Rubio as a lightweight who drinks too much water.\nBut the billionaire businessman had refrained from attacking Cruz, even as the Texas senator has surged in opinion polls, becoming Trump's most serious challenger in early-voting Iowa.\nCruz's campaign spokeswoman, Catherine Frazier, declined to comment on Trump's attacks.\nSeveral attendees at Trump's town hall event said in interviews before he spoke that they were torn between supporting Trump and Cruz, underscoring the risks each man faces going after the other too strongly.\nIndeed, Trump was relatively reserved in his criticism, repeatedly telling the crowd he liked Cruz.\nAsked at one point whether he would consider selecting Cruz as his running mate or nominating him to the Supreme Court, Trump was receptive.\n\"I would say that we would certainly have things in mind for Ted,\" he said.\nTrump took a new approach at the event at the Iowa State Fairgrounds, standing on a riser in the center of supporters, and speaking without a lectern.\nDuring his remarks, Trump stressed the importance of winning the state.\n\"If we win Iowa,\" he said, \"I think we're going to win everything after that.\"\n", :normalized_score_absolute=>50.01358655, :normalized_score_relative=>53.006610154974204}, {:title=>"Donald Trump launches first attacks against Ted Cruz", :url=>"http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/11/politics/donald-trump-ted-cruz-iowa-ethanol/index.html", :source=>"CNN", :score=>0.00129815, :type=>"positive", :content=>"Watch Jake Tapper's full interview with Donald Trump on CNN's \"State of the Union\" Sunday at 9 a.m. ET.\nDonald Trump on Friday launched his first attacks against Ted Cruz, questioning his appeal to evangelical voters and his commitment to ethanol subsidies in the first blasts by the GOP front-runner against his political ally.\nYet Trump, who has relished in whacking his Republican rivals, at times did not appear totally willing to give the same treatment to Cruz, who has yet to publicly call out Trump. Compared to some of Trump's typical barrages against his opponents, which often include long-winded and humorous asides, his comments about Cruz on Friday were restrained and concrete.\nFor five months, Cruz has refused to criticize Trump even as the rest of the Republican field turned on him for a series of incendiary comments. And Trump, in turn, has spared Cruz from the missiles he's aimed at nearly every other rival.\nBut as Cruz surges in Iowa, where Trump has long held top billing, and Cruz began to wonder aloud whether Trump could lead the country in a time of terrorism, Trump ended the peace.\n\"I do like Ted Cruz, but not a lot of evangelicals come out of Cuba,\" he told the crowd at a town hall event at the Iowa State Fairgrounds in Des Moines. \"Not a lot come out.\"\nThe father of the Texas senator, who has appealed to the born-again believers in the Hawkeye State, escaped from Cuba as a young adult. Both of Cruz's parents come from traditionally Catholic backgrounds, but Cruz grew up Southern Baptist.\nTrump's personal attack mirrors a previous joust at one-time top Iowa rival Ben Carson, who is a Seventh Day Adventist. Trump, who identifies as Presbyterian, implied that he was a more mainstream Christian. \nThe Cruz campaign declined to comment on Trump's remarks. On Saturday, however, a Cruz-aligned super PAC, Keep the Promise, hit Trump.\n\"We knew when Trump criticized Cruz it would not be substantive, but we hoped it would be coherent,\" the super PAC told CNN.\nREAD: Why Ted Cruz won't slam Trump \nThe New Yorker spent more time on Friday poking Cruz for opposing ethanol subsidies, which are widely popular there. Independent groups there are beginning to spend money against Cruz for his position, which Trump told a questioner was \"anti-Iowa.\" Cruz says the subsidies are an example of government interference in the free market.\n\"With the ethanol, really, he's got to come a long way, 'cause right now he's for the oil,\" Trump said at the beginning of his remarks, unprompted. But then he gave him an out: \"But I understand it, oil pays him a lot of money. He's got to be for oil, right?\"\n\"But I'm with you,\" he added. \"I'm self-funding. I have no oil company. I have no special interest.\"\nMuch of the money behind Cruz's well-funded super PACs does, indeed, come from oil wealth.\nTrump later called on a pro-ethanol activist with the group America's Renewable Future, who was given front-row seating Friday. The activist, who a group spokeswoman said was invited to the rally by the Trump campaign earlier this week, asked if Cruz's opposition to ethanol was because of his ties to \"big oil.\"\n\"Yes it is,\" Trump replied.\nREAD: How Cruz, Trump are trying to dominate Iowa \nBoth Trump and Cruz are appealing to the same disaffected GOP voters, and Trump has long said he would only hit Cruz if the Texas senator did so first. That appeared to come earlier this week, when The New York Times obtained audio of Cruz at a private fundraiser suggesting that Trump and Carson could not lead the nation given rising national security concerns.\nIn a tweet earlier on Friday, Trump challenged Cruz to unveil those concerns publicly, but Cruz has not yet done so. \nThe pair tends to lavish praise on one another, with Cruz recently saying that he could imagine Trump in his administration. Trump reciprocated on Friday evening.\n\"We would certainly have things in mind for Ted,\" Trump told a questioner.\nBut for the next 50 days, Cruz and Trump appear to be barreling toward a tough fight for first place in the Hawkeye State. Trump has led most polls there, but one poll from Monmouth University this week showed Cruz with a small lead.\n\"What the hell is Monmouth?\" Trump asked.
