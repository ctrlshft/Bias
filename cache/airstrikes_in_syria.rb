They established a \"supreme council\" made up of 32 opposition members and representatives of rebel factions that would later pick the 15 people who would negotiate on behalf of the opposition.\nA senior member of the Syrian National Coalition, a Western-backed opposition group, told AP that most participants agreed on its vision for a civil, democratic Syria and a transitional government that would respect human rights and the territorial integrity of Syria. Participants also agreed on the need to safeguard state institutions while restructuring the security forces.\nAlthough Western leaders have recently said Assad can stay on as part of a transition for an unspecified time, SNC and other participants at the Riyadh meeting insisted he cannot be part of a transitional government.\nU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry welcomed the \"positive outcome\" of the gathering in Riyadh where an \"extremely diverse group of Syrians put aside differences in the interest of building a new Syria.\"\n\"While this important step forward brings us closer to starting negotiations between the Syrian parties, we recognize the difficult work ahead,\" he added.\nThe stakes were high for the Riyadh meeting, during which the disparate and often competing opposition factions were held to a tight deadline to agree on the outlines of a political solution to the crisis and choose representatives for the talks.\nSecurity was exceptionally tight at the hotel venue in the Saudi capital Thursday. The entrance was blocked by armored vehicles and watched by snipers. Security guards and police kept visitors out of the hotel.\nKerry, in separate statements earlier, told reporters that he had spoken to Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to organize the next Syria meeting, tentatively set for Dec. 18 at the United Nations headquarters in New York. A peace plan agreed to last month by world powers meeting in Vienna set a Jan. 1 deadline for the start of talks between Assad's government and opposition groups.\nAlthough there was agreement on a framework for negotiation, the withdrawal of Ahrar al-Sham, whose founders are linked to al-Qaida, underscored the difficulties that lie ahead as groups with competing ideologies try to forge a common vision for the future.\nDivisions remain over whether Assad could be part of a political transition although most participants agree he should step down at the start of the transitional period, said Omar Mushaweh, a senior Muslim Brotherhood member whose party is represented at the meeting.\n\"The outcome is somewhat positive ... but it is fragile and the process can collapse at any time,\" he told The Associated Press.\nSaudi Arabia has been a key backer of Sunni opposition blocs pushing for Assad's ouster, such as the hard-line Jaysh al-Islam and Ahrar al-Sham groups that were at the talks. Also in attendance were representatives of the Syria-based National Coordination Body, an organization sometimes accused by other opposition members of being too conciliatory toward Assad's government although several of its senior members are in prison.\nAhrar al-Sham said it faced \"a religious and national duty to withdraw from the conference to protest its outcome.\" Among the reasons it listed in its statement: \"Giving a principle role for the National Coordination Body and other personalities loyal to the regime in clear violation of revolutionary work.\"\nSpeaking at a news conference earlier on Thursday, Al-Jubeir said Assad has two choices, \"either to leave through negotiations\" or be forcibly removed from power.\nThe comments drew a sharp response from Syria's Information Minister Omran al-Zoubi in Damascus, who called al-Jubeir's statements a \"farce.\"\n\"You are too insignificant to talk about matters related to the Syrian people and Syrian state, I advise you to take care of issues your own size,\" he added.\nKaram reported from Beirut.

This is the only way to deal with the militants in Syria.\n\"There\u2019s no point in meeting in New York or anywhere else without defining terrorist groups,\" he said. \"For us, in Syria, everyone who holds a machinegun is a terrorist.\"\nForeign ministers of countries opposed to Assad are due to meet in Paris on Monday to prepare for talks with Russia and Middle Eastern countries in New York on Thursday with a specific focus on trying to form the opposition delegation for the peace talks.\nBefore Assad's remarks were published, Washington said U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry would travel to Moscow on Tuesday for talks with President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.\nThe experience of a failed peace conference in Switzerland two years ago had kept expectations for the latest push low.\n\nDEMANDS THAT ASSAD LEAVE\nThe rebel groups issued a statement at the end of their two-day conference in Riyadh saying Assad should leave power at the start of a transitional period, and calling for an all-inclusive, democratic civic state.\nAlthough the demand goes beyond what Western powers are calling for, it is rejected by Assad's patrons Russia and Iran.\n                  A list of 34 members of a secretariat designated to select the opposition's negotiating team contained 11 representatives of rebel fighting groups, nine members of the exiled political opposition, six from Syria's internal opposition and eight independents.\nThe powerful Islamist insurgent group Ahrar al-Sham was represented, along with a number of FSA groups that have received military support from states opposed to Assad, such as Saudi Arabia and the United States.\nAt one point on Friday, Putin appeared to hold out an olive branch to the West, making what appeared to be Russia's first explicit statement of support for rebels opposed to Assad in the fight against Islamic State.\nAt an annual meeting at the Defence Ministry, he said the Free Syrian Army was engaged in \"offensive actions against terrorists, alongside regular forces, in the provinces of Homs, Hama, Aleppo and Raqqa\".\n\"We support it from the air, as well as the Syrian army, we assist them with weapons, ammunition and provide material support.\" he said.\nBut FSA groups dismissed any suggestion of Russian support.\nRussian air strikes have targeted a number of FSA groups in western Syria, notably factions that have received military support from Assad's foreign enemies, including anti-tank missiles. A senior Western diplomat said only about 20 percent of Russian strikes had been aimed at Islamic State.\n                  A few hours later, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to repeat Putin's assertion, saying: \"Russia supplies weapons to the legitimate authorities of the Syrian Arab Republic.\"\nAsked whether Putin had been talking about supplying FSA groups, he added: \"Please do not cling to meanings in this case. Such an interpretation is possible.\"\nThe U.S. State Department said on Friday it was unable to confirm Putin's claims. Spokesman John Kirby said, \"It's unclear to us ... whether these claims of support to the FSA are true.\" \n\nTRUCK BOMBS\nMeanwhile, Islamic State claimed a triple truck bomb attack that killed dozens of people in a part of northeastern Syria where Kurdish YPG forces have been pushing back the Islamist militants in recent weeks.\n                  The three blasts, carried out by at least two suicide bombers, went off outside a hospital, at a market and in a residential area in the town of Tel Tamer on Thursday night, the YPG's Redur Xelil said via an internet messaging service.\nHe put the toll at at least 50 dead and 80 wounded. The Asayish, a Kurdish internal security force, put the death toll at 26.\nThe YPG has been the most effective partner on the ground in Syria for the U.S.-led coalition that is pounding Islamic State from the air.\nBut it operates only in northern Syria, and is distrusted by other rebel groups, which shut it out of the Riyadh conference along with the al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, fighting alongside other rebels against Assad in western Syria.\nDifferences also remain between the groups that did attend, with many fighters considering Damascus-based political opposition figures to be too close to Assad - the same reason the YPG was excluded.\nBut the almost five-year-old conflict, in which more than 250,000 people have died, has also spawned unlikely alliances of convenience. \nTurkey's President Tayyip Erdogan said he would visit Saudi Arabia, a strong supporter of the anti-Assad rebels, soon.\n\"I will visit Saudi Arabia at the end of the month for an official visit and we will discuss a number of matters and join hands with Saudi Arabia with regard to the region's issues,\" he said in an interview with Al Jazeera.\nSenior U.S. Treasury Department official Adam Szubin said in London on Thursday that Islamic State had made more than $500 million selling oil from territory it controls, with significant volumes sold to Assad's government and some finding its way to Turkey.\nThe United Nations says the war has left 13.5 million Syrians in need of help and protection, including 400,000 living under siege and 4.5 million in areas that are hard for humanitarian assistance to reach.\nU.N. Emergency Relief Coordinator Stephen O'Brien was to meet senior government officials in Damascus on Saturday to seek ways to get more aid to those in most need.\n\n (Additional reporting by Tom Perry in Beirut; Writing by Kevin Liffey; Editing by Janet Lawrence and Louise Ireland)\n\n\n", "docSentiment"=>{"mixed"=>"1", "score"=>"-0.328124", "type"=>"negative"}}, {"status"=>"ERROR", "statusInfo"=>"cannot-retrieve:downstream-http-error:403", "usage"=>"By accessing AlchemyAPI or using information generated by AlchemyAPI, you are agreeing to be bound by the AlchemyAPI Terms of Use: http://www.alchemyapi.com/company/terms.html", "url"=>"http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/12/11/putin-says-russian-forces-in-syria-will-immediately-destroy-any-threats/", "totalTransactions"=>"1", "language"=>"unknown", "text"=>""}, {"status"=>"OK", "usage"=>"By accessing AlchemyAPI or using information generated by AlchemyAPI, you are agreeing to be bound by the AlchemyAPI Terms of Use: http://www.alchemyapi.com/company/terms.html", "url"=>"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-35060935", "totalTransactions"=>"1", "language"=>"english", "text"=>"A meeting of Syrian opposition politicians and rebels in Riyadh has produced a statement of principles to guide peace talks with the government.\nThe statement calls for a new \"pluralistic regime that represents all sectors\" in Syria, Reuters report.\nIt also stresses that President Bashar al-Assad and his aides could play no part in any transitional period.\nThere are conflicting reports as to whether the powerful rebel group Ahrar al-Sham signed the statement.\nIt had earlier complained that figures it regarded as too close to the government were being given too prominent a role, and pulled out.\nBut Reuters news agency said the group had signed the copy of the statement at the end of the two-day talks.\nWho are the groups fighting Assad?\nArab media see hope - and obstacles  \nWorld powers want negotiations between a unified opposition delegation and President Bashar al-Assad's government on a political solution to the four-and-a-half-year conflict to start by 1 January.\nOpposition groups had previously demanded Assad leave before any negotiations took place.

Perhaps the most notorious was the East Ghouta incident of August 2013, where pictures of dead or drugged children were uploaded from an Islamist-held agricultural area east of Damascus, with the claim that the Syrian Government had used chemical weapons to murder hundreds of innocents. The incident generated such attention that direct US intervention was only averted by a Russian diplomatic initiative. The Syrian Government agreed to eliminate its entire stockpile of chemical weapons (Smith-Spark and Cohen 2013), maintaining that it had never used them in the recent conflict. \nIndeed, all the independence evidence on the East Ghouta incident (including evidence from the US and the UN) shows that the Syrian Government was falsely accused. This followed a series of other false accusations, \u2018false flag\u2019 claims recorded by Mother Agnes (SANA 2011), a biased investigation into the Houla massacre (see Chapter Eight) and failed or exposed attempts to blame the Syrian Government over Islamist group killings, for example at Daraya and Aqrab (Fisk 2012; Thompson 2012). However the Islamist groups\u2019 use of chemical weapons was mostly dismissed by the western powers, and that stance has been reflected in almost all western media reports. Further, because the chemical weapon claims have been repeated for years, public perceptions seem to have little reference to facts based on evidence. After a little background, let\u2019s consider the independent evidence on the East Ghouta incident, in some detail. Arising from that evidence we are led to another serious crime of war, the fate of the dead or drugged children portrayed in those infamous images.\n9.1 Chemical Weapons in Syria\nChemical weapons are a crude relic of an earlier era, such as the trench warfare of a century ago. They have no utility in urban warfare, where an army hunts armed groups amongst streets, buildings and civilian populations. No real utility, unless a ruthless party wants to create general panic or make false claims. In the case of the Syrian Arab Army, their conventional weapons were far superior to crude chemical weapons and their urban warfare training, including that done in Iran, had the aim of rooting out terrorist groups, building by building (al Akhras 2013). A stockpile of chemical weapons had been kept as a deterrent to Israel, which holds nuclear weapons; but there had been no proven use of them in recent decades.\nBy mid-2013 the war had turned in favour of the Government. Although parts of Aleppo, east Damascus and some parts of eastern Syria were held by various Islamist groups, the Army had secured the major populated areas in western Syria and had closed much of the armed traffic across the mountainous Lebanese border. Along the borders with states which backed the Islamists \u2013 Turkey, Israel and Jordan \u2013 there were regular incursions, but they were mostly beaten back by the Syrian Army. Over May-June 2013 the Army, backed by Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah, took back the city of Qusayr, south-west of Homs, from a combination of the Farouq Brigade and Jabhat al Nusra, including many foreigners (Mortada 2013).\nIn this context anti-government armed Islamist groups were accused of using chemical weapons. The main foreign support group for the Syrian Islamists, Jabhat al Nusra, were reported to have seized a chemical factory near Aleppo in December 2012 (Gerard Direct 2012). Then in March the Syrian Government complained to the UN that sarin gas had been used in a major battle with the Islamists at Khan al Assal, west of Aleppo. The Syrian news agency SANA reported that terrorists had fired a rocket \u2018containing chemical materials\u2019, killing 16 people and wounding 86, soldiers and civilians. The death toll later rose to 25 (Barnard 2013). The Muslim Brotherhood-aligned British-based source, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, along with other anti-government \u2018activists\u2019, confirmed the casualties but insinuated that the Syrian Army might have used the weapons and \u2018accidentally\u2019 hit themselves (Barnard 2013). Western media reports mostly elevated the Islamist counter-claims to the level of the Government\u2019s report. In April 2013 Jabhat al Nusra was reported as having gained access to chlorine gas (NTI 2013).\nAbout Khan al Asal, a 19 March statement from Syria\u2019s UN Ambassador, Bashar al Ja\u2019afari, said that \u2018armed terrorist groups had fired a rocket from the Kfar De\u2019il area towards Khan Al Asal (Aleppo district) \u2026 a thick cloud of smoke had left unconscious anyone who had inhaled it. The incident reportedly resulted in the deaths of 25 people and injured more than 110 civilians and soldiers who were taken to hospitals in Aleppo\u2019. The following day the Syrian Government \u2018requested the Secretary-General to establish a specialized, impartial independent mission to investigate the alleged incident\u2019 (UNMIAUCWSAA 2013: 2-3).\nAlmost immediately following this, from 21 March onwards, the governments of the USA, France and Britain (all of which were by then directly or indirectly supporting the Islamist groups) began to add a series of incidents, claiming the use of chemical weapons in Syria (UNMIAUCWSAA 2013: 2-6). Washington repeatedly claimed there was \u2018no proof\u2019 the \u2018rebels\u2019 were responsible for chemical weapon use. They sought to turn the accusations against the Syrian Government. However, in an interim statement in May, UN investigator Carla del Ponte said she had testimony from victims that \u2018rebels\u2019 had used sarin gas (BBC 2013). Then in May, Turkish security forces were reported to have found a 2kg canister of sarin, after raiding the homes of Jabhat al Nusra fighters (RT 2013). In July Russia announced it had evidence that Syrian \u2018rebels\u2019 were making their own sarin gas (Al Jazeera 2013).\nDespite dissatisfaction over the Houla inquiry the previous year the Syrian Government invited UN inspectors to visit the Khan al Asal attack site. Details were organised and the UN\u2019s Special Mission finally arrived in Damascus on 18 August 2013. The Mission \u2018intended to contemporaneously investigate the reported allegations of the use of chemical weapons in Khan Al Asal, Saraqueb and Sheik Maqsood\u2019, that is, at three of the 16 reported sites where such attacks \u2018were deemed credible\u2019. However, \u2018after the tragic events of 21 August 2013\u2019 the UN Secretary General directed the group to investigate the East Ghouta incident \u2018as a matter of priority\u2019 (UNMIAUCWSAA 2013: 7-8). This incident derailed the initially planned investigations. Despite the implausibility of the Syrian Government launching a chemical weapons attack, just as it had invited UN inspectors in Damascus, the new claims gained world attention.\n9.2 The East Ghouta Incident\nThe main armed Islamist group which controlled the area, the Saudi-backed Islamic Front (Liwa al Islam), blamed the Government for gassing children. Photos of dozens of dead or injured children were circulated. Supporting the \u2018rebel\u2019 accusations, the US government and the US-based Human Rights Watch blamed the Syrian government. Human Rights Watch said it had \u2018analyzed witness accounts of the rocket attacks, information on the likely source of the attacks, the physical remnants of the weapon systems used\u2019, and claimed the rockets used were \u2018weapon systems known and documented to be only in the possession of, and used by, Syrian government armed forces\u2019 (HRW 2013a). Much the same was said by the US Government. Close links between the two should tell us that this was more collaboration than corroboration. A group of Nobel Prize winners would later accuse Human Rights Watch of running a \u2018revolving door\u2019 between its offices and those of the US government (P\u00E9rez Esquivel and Maguire 2014).\nThe New York Times backed the US Government claim \u2018that only Syrian government forces had the ability to carry out such a strike\u2019 (Gladstone and Chivers 2013). The paper claimed vector calculations of the rocket trajectories indicated they must have been fired from Syrian Army bases in Damascus (Parry 2013). Yet studies at MIT quickly showed the rockets to have a much shorter range than was suggested. The NYT retreated from its telemetry claims saying, while \u2018some argued that it was still possible the government was responsible\u2019, new evidence \u2018undermined the Obama administration\u2019s assertions\u2019 about the rocket launch points\u2019 (Chivers 2013; also Parry 2013). The final MIT report was more emphatic, concluding that the rockets \u2018could not possibly have been fired at East Ghouta from the \u2018heart\u2019, or from the eastern edge, of the Syrian Government controlled area shown in the intelligence map published by the White House on August 30, 2013\u2019 (Lloyd and Postol 2014).\nWhile western media outlets mostly repeated Washington\u2019s accusations, independent reports continued to contradict the story. Journalists Dale Gavlak and Yahya Ababneh reported direct interviews with \u2018doctors, Ghouta residents, rebel fighters and their families\u2019 in the East Ghouta area. Many believed that the Islamists had received chemical weapons via Saudi intelligence chief, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, and were responsible for carrying out the gas attack (Gavlak and Ababneh 2013). The father of a rebel said his son had asked \u2018what I thought the weapons were that he had been asked to carry\u2019. His son and 12 other rebels were \u2018killed inside of a tunnel used to store weapons provided by a Saudi militant, known as Abu Ayesha\u2019 (Gavlak and Ababneh 2013). A female fighter complained they had no instructions on how to use chemical weapons. A rebel leader said much the same. Many of those interviewed reported that their salaries came from the Saudi government (Gavlak and Ababneh 2013).\nNext a Syrian group, ISTEAMS, led by Mother Agnes Mariam, carried out a detailed examination of the video evidence, noting that bodies had been manipulated for the images and that many of the children appeared ill or drugged (ISTEAMS 2013: 32-35). The videos used \u2018artificial scenic treatment \u2026 there is a flagrant lack of real families in East Ghouta \u2026 so who are the children that are exposed in those videos?\u2019 (ISTEAMS 2013: 44). How is it that there are so many children without parents, the report asked? All reports came from \u2018rebel\u2019 controlled areas. The medical office of the area claimed 10,000 injured and 1,466 killed, 67% of whom were women and children; while the Local Coordinating Committee (by this time an FSA linked group) said there were 1,188 victims. Videos showed less than 500 bodies, by no means all dead (ISTEAMS 2013: 36-38). Even more striking was the subsequent absence of verified bodies. \u2018Eight corpses are seen buried. [The] remaining 1,458 corpses, where are they? Where are the children?\u2019 (ISTEAMS 2013: 41). A \u2018rebel\u2019 spokesperson claimed that \u2018burials took place quickly for fear the bodies might decompose as a result of the heat\u2019 (Mroue 2013).\nThe ISTEAMS report suggested a possible link with a large scale abduction of children in Ballouta, Northern Latakia, just two weeks prior to the East Ghouta incident.\nThe report said:\nAt the end of 2013 a Turkish lawyers and writers group issued a substantial report on crimes against civilians in Syria. A particular focus was the responsibility of the Turkish Government, which was backing the \u2018rebel\u2019 groups. The report concluded that \u2018most of the crimes\u2019 against Syrian civilians, including the East Ghouta attack, were committed by \u2018armed rebel forces in Syria\u2019. The Saudi backed group Liwa al Islam, led by Zahran Alloush, was said \u2018by several sources to be the organization behind the chemical attack (Peace Association and Lawyers for Justice 2013).\nThe US storyline received another blow, from within the US. Veteran North American journalist Seymour Hersh interviewed US intelligence agents and concluded that Washington\u2019s claims on the evidence had been fabricated. Al Nusra \u2018should have been a suspect\u2019, he said, \u2018but the [US] administration cherry picked intelligence to justify a strike against Assad\u2019 (Hersh 2013). President Obama cited as evidence the Syrian Army\u2019s preparation for a gas attack and \u2018chatter\u2019 on the Syrian airwaves at the time of the incident. However Hersh said he had found \u2018intense concern\u2019 and anger amongst US agents over \u2018the deliberate manipulation of intelligence\u2019. One officer said the attack \u2018was not the result of the current regime\u2019 (Hersh 2013). The White House backgrounder combined facts after the event with those before. Hersh concludes that the White House \u2018disregarded the available intelligence about al-Nusra\u2019s potential access to sarin and continued to [wrongly] claim that the Assad government was in sole possession of chemical weapons\u2019 (Hersh 2013).\nThe UN special mission on chemical weapons returned to Syria in late September and investigated several sites, including East Ghouta. They decided to investigate seven of the initial sixteen reports (UNMIAUCWSAA 2013: 10). This Mission was not briefed to determined responsibility, but rather to determine whether chemical weapons had been used and what had been the results. In a December 2013 report they reported that chemical weapons had been used in Syria, and specifically\nNotice that on three of these five occasions chemical weapons were used against soldiers. Logically those attacks came from groups which were fighting soldiers, not from government forces. A later report for the Human Rights Council (February 2014) noted that the chemical agents used in Khan-Al-Assal attack \u2018bore the same unique hallmarks as those used in al Ghouta\u2019; however they could not determine the perpetrator (HRC 2014: 19). The independent evidence was overwhelming and inescapable: chemical weapons had been used in East Ghouta, but the charges against the Syrian Army were fabricated.\nEvidence independent of the Syrian Government came from Syrian, Jordanian, Turkish and US sources, and from a United Nations team. Further, many of the images of sick of dead children were not reliably linked to East Ghouta.\nNor is there independent verification of who those children are and what happened to them. The weight of evidence shows this to be another \u2018false flag\u2019 incident, designed to attract deeper foreign intervention. The scale of independent reporting which undermined claims against the Syrian Government stands in marked contrast to the boastful self-publicity by \u2018rebels\u2019 of their own atrocities: beheadings, public executions, truck bombings, mortaring of cities, bombing of hospitals and destruction of mosques and churches. The fact that the Syrian Army strongly contests civilian atrocity claims (the treatment of captured fighters is another matter), while many of the \u2018rebels\u2019 publicise their own atrocities, sets a distinct background to these controversies.\n9.3. Chemical fabrications and Syria\u2019s Missing Children \nAfter the East Ghouta incident, Islamist groups supported by a range of states opposed to Syria maintained the chemical accusations. Jabhat al Nusra claimed the chemicals they were caught with in Turkey were \u2018not for making sarin gas\u2019 (Today\u2019s Zaman 2013). Yet video evidence from south Syria showed al Nusra using chemical weapons against Syrian soldiers (Turbeville 2014). In July 2014 barrels containing sarin were reported as discovered in parts of \u2018rebel-held Syria\u2019 (RT 2014). Then in 2015 Iraqi Kurds reported the other main al Qaeda group ISIS as using chemical weapons (Solomon 2015; Ariel 2015). Kurdish fighters seized chlorine canisters after a suicide bomb attack which left them \u2018dizzy, nauseous and weak\u2019 (Akbar 2015).\nAnti-Syrian \u2018activists\u2019, plus US-based NGOs such as Avaaz, the Syria Campaign and The White Helmets, repeated and extended the accusations, urging a Libyan styled \u2018no fly zone\u2019 (NFZ Syria 2015; White Helmets 2015), clearly intended to topple the Government in Damascus. By 2014 there seemed little chance that would happen. In April 2014 Al Jazeera again accused the Syrian Government of using chlorine gas (Baker 2014), while anonymous activists\u2019 accused the Syrian army of a poison gas attack (Mroue and Lucas 2015). In neither case was there any independent verification. Nevertheless, media channels repeated the initial claims of the East Ghouta incident, as though they were fact, oblivious to the evidence. An April 2015 article in the UK Guardian, for example, claimed in its backgrounder that the Syrian Government had used chemical weapons and \u2018killed up to 1,400 people in August 2013\u2019 (Black 2015). Such was the reckless disinformation.\nThe smokescreens around chemical weapons effectively derailed reasonable western discussion about the war in Syria; and perhaps that was the point. It is sad, though, that reasonable discussion of the evidence should matter so little. Further, the constant stream of fabrications have certainly aggravated and helped prolong the violence. Islamist militia carry out their crimes with relative impunity, regularly blaming them on the Syrian Government.\nAnother crime has been buried by the chemical fabrications: the fate of the children kidnapped in Ballouta. Even Human Rights Watch reported this crime (HRW 2013b), if not the link to the children said to have been injured or killed in East Ghouta. This mass kidnapping was just one of many by the armed groups. The victims are held for ransom, for prisoner exchanges, or simply slaughtered because they are thought be from pro-government families. However in the East Ghouta incident, several sources (ISTEAMS 2013; Martin 2014; Mesler 2014) link the Ballouta children to the photos of the dead or drugged little bodies said to have bene in the East Ghouta. That is, their images may have been uploaded from East Ghouta but the bodies were never there. While some of those kidnapped were released in a 2014 prisoner exchange, many are still held, reportedly in Selma.\nThis is said to be why many families in northern Syria did not wish to publicly identify their children. They want to free those that have survived. Western media sources continue refer to \u20181,400\u2019 dead, without names, but only eight bodies are known to have been buried. In the fog of war, Mother Agnes Mariam has been right all along to insist on names and details of people killed, and not just a recital of numbers, as though these killings were a cricket match. Back in September 2013 her ISTEAMS group posed one of the most vital questions of this whole affair: \u2018Eight corpses are seen buried\u2019. [The] remaining 1,458 corpses, where are they? Where are the children?\u2019 (ISTEAMS 2013: 41).\nReferences:\nAl Akhras, Samer (2013) Interview with this writer, Damascus, 24 December\nAl Jazeera (2013) \u2018Syria rebels made own sarin gas, says Russia\u2019, 10 July, online: http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/07/20137920448105510.html \u00A0\nAnderson, Tim (2015) \u2018The Houla Massacre Revisited: \u201COfficial Truth\u201D in the Dirty War on Syria\u2019, Global Research, 24 March, online: http://www.globalresearch.ca/houla-revisited-official-truth-in-the-dirty-war-on-syria/5438441 \u00A0\nAriel, Ben (2015) \u2018United States \u2018concerned\u2019 about ISIS use of chlorine gas\u2019, Arutz Sheva, 17 March, online: http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/192730#.VSJJc5MY6q4 \u00A0\nBaker, Graeme (2014) \u2018Syrian regime accused of chlorine gas attacks\u2019, Al Jazeera, 17 April, online: http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/04/syrian-regime-accused-chlorine-gas-attacks-201441703230338216.html \u00A0\nBarnard, Anne (2013) \u2018Syria and Activists Trade Charges on Chemical Weapons\u2019, New York Times, 19 March, online: http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/20/world/middleeast/syria-developments.html?pagewanted=all\nBBC (2013) UN\u2019s Del Ponte says evidence Syria rebels \u2018used sarin\u2019\u2019, 6 May, online: http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-22424188 \u00A0\nBlack, Ian (2015) \u2018Former ambassador attacks Cameron\u2019s \u2018arrogant\u2019 Syria policy\u2019, UK Guardian, 8 April, online: http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/07/former-ambassador-attacks-camerons-arrogant-syria-policy\nEva Pal (2014) \u2018Talk with Lilly Martin and Steven Sahiounie, part 1\u2019, YouTube, May 10, online: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oc2HRk42O-w\nGerard Direct (2012) \u2018Syria: jihadist al-Nusra Front seizes chemical factory near Aleppo\u2019, 9 December, online: http://gerarddirect.com/2012/12/09/syria-jihadist-al-nusra-front-siezes-chemical-factory-in-allepo/ \u00A0\nHersh, Seymour M.
