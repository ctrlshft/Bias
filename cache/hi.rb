It is indigenous to the more arid parts of southern Africa. It is has been used historically by indigenous healers and more recently has been commercialised, and is sold dried and used to make a \u201Ctea\u201D to be taken medicinally. \nCarine Smith, head of the stress biology research group at the department of physiological science at the university, said health organisations, particularly in developing countries, had promoted the use of Sutherlandia as an immune-booster for HIV-positive people before beginning antiretroviral therapy. However, she said while earlier research had supported the benefits of taking Sutherlandia for reducing stress in healthy people, \u201Cthe picture changes when an individual is infected with the HI virus\u201D. \nThe HI virus caused chronic inflammation of the central nervous system soon after an individual became infected. This promoted neuro-degeneration and dementia. \nShe said their data, obtained in a cell co-culture simulation of the human blood-brain barrier, supported earlier work of the beneficial action of Sutherlandia, but only in non-HIV conditions. \n\u201CIn the HIV condition, HIV-associated proteins caused more severe neuro-inflammation as more immune cells moved across the blood-brain barrier after being treated with Sutherlandia.\u201D \nShe said the research, published in the Journal of Negative Results in BioMedicine, did not argue against the use of Sutherlandia as originally prescribed by \u201Cindigenous knowledge practitioners\u201D. \n\u201COur research on plant medicines is aimed at distinguishing between populations and conditions that would most benefit from a specific plant, and those who would do better to avoid talking it at all.  We therefore caution against the use of Sutherlandia frutescens at any stage post-HIV infection.\u201D \nGet our free Lifestyle newsletter - subscribe here...\n", :normalized_score_absolute=>29.0217, :normalized_score_relative=>0.0}, {:title=>"Hi-Crush Partners Deletes Its Distribution - Now What?", :url=>"http://seekingalpha.com/article/3725136-hi-crush-partners-deletes-its-distribution-now-what", :source=>"Seeking Alpha", :score=>-0.194312, :type=>"negative", :content=>"Another dividend in the oil patch got cancelled when Hi-Crush Partners (NYSE:HCLP) opted to discontinue its distribution on its third quarter report. It's not hard to see why: Hi-Crush is a proppant sand provider. Frac sand is a necessary ingredient in shale drilling. Shale drilling, of course, is one of the higher-cost sources of supply to have entered the market over the last decade, and so the shale is also one of the hardest-hit by low oil prices.\nBefore the oil price crash, Hi-Crush was riding the wave of the so-called 'frac sand supercycle.' E&Ps were using more sand per drilling lateral, which meant more demand for frac sand. E&Ps were also increasing the number of laterals per well, which meant more demand for sand. Horizontal wells per rig were increasing, which also meant more sand was needed. Finally, rig counts themselves had been going up, which, of course, meant more sand. The bear market in crude has collapsed that equation, and this has caused Hi-Crush to cancel its distribution.\nBut where do we go now? This article takes a look at Hi-Crush's response to this bear market and its prospects in the coming years.\nHi-Crush operates four sand processing facilities in western Wisconsin; which is home to North America's only economical sources of high-quality Northern White sand. Hi-Crush also owns rail terminal facilities all over the Utica and Marcellus shales, and then a few terminal facilities in West Texas.\nHi-Crush's newest sand facility is in Augusta, WI, and the facility was just about ready when management idled the facility. Management's reasoning for idling its Augusta plant is pretty clear: Frac sand volumes are expected to fall 15% across the board this year, and Hi Crush's realized sand prices are expected to decline by 10%-15% in the fourth quarter alone, with no real guidance for 2016.\nIn other words, Hi-Crush needed to do something in response, and the company's response was to idle its lowest-margin, least established plant. In closing Augusta, Hi-Crush is shelving 2.6 million tons per day of capacity, and will save itself between $800,000 and $1 million per month. Also, next year Hi-Crush will reduce its capex from $50 million to just $15 million.\nAs a result of macroeconomic conditions, Hi-Crush's ability to pay a distribution has gone down the tube. Last quarter, for example, Hi-Crush generated only $9 million in operating cash flow. So, even if Hi-Crush wanted to pay a distribution, it wouldn't be able to pay a meaningful one at this time.\nCourtesy of Sharp Charts.\nAs you can see, Hi-Crush has gone from the mid-$30s to just $7.75 per share. Many names in the energy space have eliminated their dividend in order to survive. That is not the case with Hi-Crush, because Hi-Crush's debt load is actually quite manageable. The partnership has only two securities outstanding: A term loan of $195 million and a revolving credit line with a balance of $52.5 million. The term loan comes due in 2021, and the credit line comes due in 2019. That's it.\nAs long as creditors can be flexible with the existing debt-to-EBITDA covenant (and they have been), there's little reason to fear bankruptcy from Hi-Crush. The distribution has been cut all the way to zero, this could be an excellent recovery play. The shale will continue to be an important part of the global crude oil production picture. \nThe current excess production in the world is still only about 2 million barrels per day, and the shale itself produces 5 million barrels per day. So, even if all the excess production comes out of the shale (which it won't, because deepwater and the oil sands are getting hit as well), then the US shale will still produce as much as Iran or Venezuela.\nFurthermore, smaller players in the frac sand business are 'dropping like flies,' according to management. This field will be a much smaller one when the dust all settles. Hi-Crush is arguably already the best-of-breed in this field. Hi-Crush certainly has among the lowest cost base. For reasons mentioned in the beginning of this article, Hi-Crush is a business that will grow DCF as long as the shale is healthy.\nI believe that Hi-Crush could be a speculative buy at this point. While there won't be any big upward catalyst for the stock, not at least until the shale becomes profitable again, the shoes have already dropped for this one. I was cautious on this name six months ago, but I believe there is now more clarity on this name.\n", :normalized_score_absolute=>40.2844, :normalized_score_relative=>24.578083957094563}, {:title=>"Hi-Crush Partners LP (HCLP) Research Coverage Started at DA Davidson", :url=>"http://www.mideasttime.com/hi-crush-partners-lp-hclp-research-coverage-started-at-da-davidson/609196/", :source=>"Mideast Times", :score=>0.103216, :type=>"positive", :content=>"DA Davidson initiated coverage on shares of Hi-Crush Partners LP (NASDAQ:HCLP) in a report issued on Monday, The Fly reports.

It has a built-in 240mW amplifier and it\u2019s totally analog, baby! It also has three bass modes to choose from, so you\u00A0can decide between passive, active or\u00A0enhanced\u00A0bass.\nThe built-in 1020mAh\u00A0rechargeable\u00A0battery can give you up to 12 hours of music. It senses when you fold them, so they\u2019ll power down to save battery life. Good news is it will still operate passively when no battery\u00A0juice is left.\nJust a warning, they are a tad on the heavy side,\u00A0weighing\u00A0in at just under 0.5 kg but there\u2019s a lot going on under the hood and they do pack a big punch. In fact they\u2019d make for great monitors.\nMo-Fi Powered Hi-Fi Headphones retail in Canada for $429.95 and are available from the Apple Store , London Drugs and directly from Blue via Amazon.\nPhiaton Foldable Noise\u00A0Cancelling\nIf your intended gift recipient is looking for a full-featured wireless Bluetooth 4.0 headphones that are perhaps are a little smaller to carry around and a little lighter, then you might want to have a look at the active noise cancelling Phiaton BT-330NC.\nThe BT-330NC is an on-ear style headphone and shares some similar features to its funky earbud cousin the BT-110 we reviewed here in November. This includes\u00A0Multi-Point Connection so you can be connected or paired with two devices at the same time. This means that you can listen and play on your iPad then seamlessly grab a call on your iPhone.\nAll the controls are conveniently located on the rim of the cups including power, pairing, song control and the noise cancellation button designed to eliminate unwanted outside noise. There\u2019s also a built-in mic on the right cup so you can wirelessly take and make calls.\u00A0And, in the event you do need to be wired, it also comes with a connecting cable complete with in-line mic and remote control. Hopefully that won\u2019t be the case as the rechargeable battery is rated at 14 hour music, 29 hours standby and recharges in a little over three hours.\nAnd they sound great, too! Phiaton prides themselves on fine tuning their 40 mm drivers so they keep the highs crisp while at the same time adding slightly oversized Neodymium magnets\u00A0to not lose the deep bass.\nThey also fold just above each ear cup making it easier to pack around.\nSo if you want to forgo the earbuds and the wires, the Phiaton BT 330 NC might be the right gift choice. It comes with a USB charging cable in addition to the audio cable and a matching carry case. It retails for $199 U.S. and available through Amazon.\nIf your loved one prefers to tune out the world or perhaps needs to wear their headphones all day, then the Plantronics BackBeat SENSE \u00A0just\u00A0might\u00A0be the right gift for them.\u00A0The name Plantronics, might spring to mind industrial call-centre gear, but\u00A0that my friends is so much\u00A0far than the truth.\nAt first glance they\u2019re somewhat\u00A0reminiscent of traditional\u00A0headphones, but\u00A0as you put them on you immediately feel its self-adjusting headband.\u00A0They are also very comfortable thanks to the soft memory foam cushioned ear cups. They adjust quite nicely to your ear. In fact after a\u00A0while\u00A0you may forget you are wearing them.\nThe BackBeat SENSE\u2019s claim to fame is that \u201Cit doesn\u2019t miss a beat\u201D. This means the moment you remove your headset they will\u00A0automatically pause your music. \u00A0This can be handy so you don\u2019t have to reach for your pause button and automatically resume when you put them back on.\nIt has an extremely long battery life,\u00A0designed\u00A0to\u00A0stream up to 18 hours on a single charge, last 21 days on standby and up to six months when put into deep sleep mode. Amazingly, it recharges in about 2 1/2 hours.\nAnother interesting fact is that unlike many other Bluetooth devices, this one is rated with a range of\u00A0up to 100 m from your phone or tablet.\nBackBeat SENSE by Plantronics comes in two models:\u00A0Black/Espresso or White/Tan and retails for $229.99.

Naim is a premium audio brand from Salisbury in England. Contrary to popular legend, the name is not an acronym for 'new age in music'.\u00A0The truth is rather less grand.\n\n\nIt resulted from a 1973 pub discussion to find a suitable moniker. After maybe too many drinks, the upshot was to name it name, only spelled differently. Sales director Doug Graham, who's been there for 25 years, says the acronym story began in Asia because explaining the joke to people who don't speak English is just too hard.\n\n\nNow down to business. Naim has lately seen the one true path, and it is streaming. Even if you're inordinately proud of your massive CD collection, the company believes you'll see the light before long too. Graham speaks of streaming with the passion of the converted.\n\n\n\"Let's say you have 700 CDs in your shelves,\" he says. \"You probably only wind up listening to a small number of them, stacked beside the player because when you want to listen to something else you have to find it first.\n\n\n\"There are probably lots of CDs in there you've only listened to once and others where you've only played one track. There will be CDs that you have two copies of because you forgot you had the first when you bought the second and there's likely some great music in there that you've totally forgotten about.\"\n\n\nEmbarrassingly familiar? The solution, he says, is storing your music digitally and streaming it to your stereo. Set it for playing a genre, or simply put it on shuffle, and you'll start hearing the stuff you've missed or didn't know you had. Streaming makes playing music easy.\n\n\nAh, but what of sound quality? He has a most effective demonstration to allay my fears.\n\n\nHe streams music wirelessly from a Mu-so, Naim's music streamer, to a stereo system that retails for roughly half a million dollars. It's centred on the company's premium Statement amplification system, two gorgeous monobloc\u00A0amplifiers and a matching pre-amp ($355,000), feeding a pair of massive Focal Stella Utopia speakers ($150,000). Such a system sounds spectacular with a great signal, but if that signal gets bad, every little problem becomes a big one.\n\n\nThe music from the Mu-so is stunning. Even on a system as demanding as this, it's clearly defined, razor-sharp and fast, with a shimmering delicacy normally associated with electrostatic speakers. It's a treat. And the Mu-so is by far the cheapest link in the chain at $1699.\n\n\nIt's Naim's first wireless music system, and streams high resolution music wirelessly or through an Ethernet connection. It also has AirPlay and Bluetooth AptX, and there's a USB input and a 3.5mm analogue audio plug. With an app, it accepts music from a computer or tablet, and these can also be used to control it.\n\n\nBut it's more than that. It has two tweeters, two mids and two bass reflexes, each driver powered by its own digital amplifier, to make it a stand-alone music system that sounds better than it should for its size and price.\n\n\nThe stereo system Graham demonstrated may have cost $500,000, but it was the Mu-so that most impressed me, especially at the price. Note that you can't hook it into an existing stereo with cables;\u00A0the 3.5mm, Ethernet and USB are the only connections it has.\n\n\nBy the way, I've never seen a monobloc amplifier that looks good. That is, I've never seen one my wife would allow in the house. Until now. Naim's Statement amplification system, consisting of two 746-watt monoblocs and a matching pre-amp, is striking.\n\n\nMonoblocs are mostly big, ugly cubes with massive heat\u00A0sinks placed wherever they're needed, but these have been designed vertically with the noisy power supply at the base, isolated from the delicate electronics above by an acrylic centrepiece that blocks interference. The heat\u00A0sinks at the side are sculpted from a single block of aluminium and take a day to make. Their surfaces flow like soundwaves.\n\n\nThe pre-amp sits between these two with a generous, individually lit volume control wheel atop and power and source buttons at the rear of the top panel.\n\n\n\u00A0\n\n\n", :normalized_score_absolute=>63.71245, :normalized_score_relative=>75.70406439260375}, {:title=>"Huawei wants to become the backbone of IoT boom with Hi-Link, Lite OS", :url=>"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/huawei-wants-to-become-the-backbone-of-iot-boom-with-hi-link-lite-os/", :source=>"The Indian Express", :score=>0.375963, :type=>"positive", :content=>" \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Huawei announced partnerships with Haier and Broadlink for connected appliances and also announced that its new Lite OS SDK will be open for everyone to develop new things. \nHuawei is going back to what it does best \u2013 connect people and now things.
