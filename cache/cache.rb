This is the only way to deal with the militants in Syria.\n\"There\u2019s no point in meeting in New York or anywhere else without defining terrorist groups,\" he said. \"For us, in Syria, everyone who holds a machinegun is a terrorist.\"\nForeign ministers of countries opposed to Assad are due to meet in Paris on Monday to prepare for talks with Russia and Middle Eastern countries in New York on Thursday with a specific focus on trying to form the opposition delegation for the peace talks.\nBefore Assad's remarks were published, Washington said U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry would travel to Moscow on Tuesday for talks with President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.\nThe experience of a failed peace conference in Switzerland two years ago had kept expectations for the latest push low.\n\nDEMANDS THAT ASSAD LEAVE\nThe rebel groups issued a statement at the end of their two-day conference in Riyadh saying Assad should leave power at the start of a transitional period, and calling for an all-inclusive, democratic civic state.\nAlthough the demand goes beyond what Western powers are calling for, it is rejected by Assad's patrons Russia and Iran.\n                  A list of 34 members of a secretariat designated to select the opposition's negotiating team contained 11 representatives of rebel fighting groups, nine members of the exiled political opposition, six from Syria's internal opposition and eight independents.\nThe powerful Islamist insurgent group Ahrar al-Sham was represented, along with a number of FSA groups that have received military support from states opposed to Assad, such as Saudi Arabia and the United States.\nAt one point on Friday, Putin appeared to hold out an olive branch to the West, making what appeared to be Russia's first explicit statement of support for rebels opposed to Assad in the fight against Islamic State.\nAt an annual meeting at the Defence Ministry, he said the Free Syrian Army was engaged in \"offensive actions against terrorists, alongside regular forces, in the provinces of Homs, Hama, Aleppo and Raqqa\".\n\"We support it from the air, as well as the Syrian army, we assist them with weapons, ammunition and provide material support.\" he said.\nBut FSA groups dismissed any suggestion of Russian support.\nRussian air strikes have targeted a number of FSA groups in western Syria, notably factions that have received military support from Assad's foreign enemies, including anti-tank missiles. A senior Western diplomat said only about 20 percent of Russian strikes had been aimed at Islamic State.\n                  A few hours later, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to repeat Putin's assertion, saying: \"Russia supplies weapons to the legitimate authorities of the Syrian Arab Republic.\"\nAsked whether Putin had been talking about supplying FSA groups, he added: \"Please do not cling to meanings in this case. Such an interpretation is possible.\"\nThe U.S. State Department said on Friday it was unable to confirm Putin's claims. Spokesman John Kirby said, \"It's unclear to us ... whether these claims of support to the FSA are true.\" \n\nTRUCK BOMBS\nMeanwhile, Islamic State claimed a triple truck bomb attack that killed dozens of people in a part of northeastern Syria where Kurdish YPG forces have been pushing back the Islamist militants in recent weeks.\n                  The three blasts, carried out by at least two suicide bombers, went off outside a hospital, at a market and in a residential area in the town of Tel Tamer on Thursday night, the YPG's Redur Xelil said via an internet messaging service.\nHe put the toll at at least 50 dead and 80 wounded. The Asayish, a Kurdish internal security force, put the death toll at 26.\nThe YPG has been the most effective partner on the ground in Syria for the U.S.-led coalition that is pounding Islamic State from the air.\nBut it operates only in northern Syria, and is distrusted by other rebel groups, which shut it out of the Riyadh conference along with the al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, fighting alongside other rebels against Assad in western Syria.\nDifferences also remain between the groups that did attend, with many fighters considering Damascus-based political opposition figures to be too close to Assad - the same reason the YPG was excluded.\nBut the almost five-year-old conflict, in which more than 250,000 people have died, has also spawned unlikely alliances of convenience. \nTurkey's President Tayyip Erdogan said he would visit Saudi Arabia, a strong supporter of the anti-Assad rebels, soon.\n\"I will visit Saudi Arabia at the end of the month for an official visit and we will discuss a number of matters and join hands with Saudi Arabia with regard to the region's issues,\" he said in an interview with Al Jazeera.\nSenior U.S. Treasury Department official Adam Szubin said in London on Thursday that Islamic State had made more than $500 million selling oil from territory it controls, with significant volumes sold to Assad's government and some finding its way to Turkey.\nThe United Nations says the war has left 13.5 million Syrians in need of help and protection, including 400,000 living under siege and 4.5 million in areas that are hard for humanitarian assistance to reach.\nU.N.

Also in attendance were representatives of the Syria-based National Coordination Body, an organization sometimes accused by other opposition members of being too conciliatory toward Assad's government although several of its senior members are in prison.\nAhrar al-Sham said it faced \"a religious and national duty to withdraw from the conference to protest its outcome.\" Among the reasons it listed in its statement: \"Giving a principle role for the National Coordination Body and other personalities loyal to the regime in clear violation of revolutionary work.\"\nSpeaking at a news conference earlier on Thursday, Al-Jubeir said Assad has two choices, \"either to leave through negotiations\" or be forcibly removed from power.\nThe comments drew a sharp response from Syria's Information Minister Omran al-Zoubi in Damascus, who called al-Jubeir's statements a \"farce.\"\n\"You are too insignificant to talk about matters related to the Syrian people and Syrian state, I advise you to take care of issues your own size,\" he added.\nKaram reported from Beirut.

They\u2019re losing ground to absurd figures who used to be jokes, rabble-rousers, fringe players on the margins of political life. Who would have thought, a year ago, that serious people would be in such a panic over how to stop the likes of Marine Le Pen and Donald Trump?\nOver here, the appalling vulgarian has sucked up all the airtime, like some particularly virulent black hole. The more outrageous he gets, the higher his ratings soar. Mr. Trump degrades political debate. He poses a mortal threat to the Republican Party, which he airily dismisses as a gang of idiots. But they have no idea how to stop him.\nOver there, Ms. Le Pen and her ravishing young niece, Marion Mar\u00E9chal-Le Pen, have trampled the mainstream parties under their chic high heels. Last week their far-right anti-immigration, anti-Europe party, the National Front, won nearly 30 per cent of the vote in the first round of regional elections. Reaction in Europe ranged from fear to panic to outright horror. \u201CFrance\u2019s fascist uprising,\u201D blared Britain\u2019s Independent. Political columnist Fran\u00E7oise Fressoz wrote, \u201CThe political reality in France can now be summed up in one question. Who can stop Marine Le Pen?\u201D\nThe source of their appeal isn\u2019t hard to find. In both countries, the dominant political class has failed miserably to understand and address the anxieties of large numbers of middle-class people.\n\u201CDonald Trump says things no one else dares to say,\u201D his fans tell you. When he said the U.S. should deport its millions of illegal Mexican immigrants, they cheered. When he said Muslims should be banned from immigrating, the political and media class expressed universal horror. But in the fevered wake of the San Bernardino slaughter, many people thought: Why not? When a recent poll asked respondents if the values of Islam are incompatible with the American way of life, 76 per cent of Republicans answered yes. And 43 per cent of Democrats also answered yes.\nThat\u2019s the genius of Trumpism. There\u2019s Donald Trump \u2013 and then there\u2019s everybody else, yelling that he can\u2019t say that. That\u2019s why he\u2019s the Republican front-runner.\nPopulists come up with simplistic answers to complex questions \u2013 questions the elites would prefer not to address. Mr. Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant stance is purely opportunistic. But the utter failure of both Republicans and Democrats to tackle immigration reform in any meaningful way has left the field wide open.\nIt\u2019s the same with Marine Le Pen. People take to her because she stands up for ordinary folks \u2013 especially the rural and small-town folks, the young and unemployed folks, the folks who\u2019ve been hit hard by massive deindustrialization. Unlike Mr. Trump, she\u2019s not a flame-thrower. She comes across as moderate and reasoned. She\u2019s worked hard to scrub the party clean of its overtly racist past. But she, too, has been able to capitalize on the the mainstream parties\u2019 widespread failure to tackle France\u2019s serious economic and immigration woes.\nIt\u2019s fashionable to write off the people who respond to Mr. Trump and Ms. Le Pen as ignorant lowbrows, who can\u2019t adjust to modernity, to progress and to newcomers. That has been the standard response of the pundits and political elites. And that is a big part of the problem. The triumph of two of them has less to do with the baser instincts of the voters than with the incompetence of the current leadership. \u201C[Le Pen\u2019s] success is due to the failures and vacuum of the centre right, the weak conservatism of the Socialist Party, and the inability of the EU to respond to serious European challenges,\u201D The New York Times\u2019s Steven Erlanger told Carnegie Europe. Similarly, Mr. Trump\u2019s success is in large part due to the Republicans\u2019 inability to craft an appealing alternative to the Democrats. In both countries, many people don\u2019t see much difference among the old ruling parties. They\u2019re all part of the same old gang, and only a new outsider can bust them up.\nBoth Mr. Trump and Ms. LePen have profited hugely from the shock of domestic terrorism. But the unease they feed on is much deeper than that. \u201CThis sense of fury has a long history,\u201D wrote Alexis Brezet, editor of Le Figaro. \u201CIt is a cold, brutal, unsubtle, merciless fury. It has been brewed by 30 years of state weakness and government failures.\u201D People feel the values they hold dear are slipping away. Mr. Trump and Ms. Le Pen are promising to bring them back again.\nHow far will they go? My guess: The Republicans will rally round another champion and Donald Trump will probably be gone by March. (Whether he\u2019ll decide to run as an independent is anybody\u2019s guess. Hillary Clinton can only hope so.) Marine Le Pen won\u2019t go the distance either. Even so, their profound challenges to the old order aren\u2019t going to go away.

And that's about as diplomatic as I can be about it.\"\n \tOne by one, Republican officials across the country lashed out at Trump's plan, which calls for a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\" to help quell the threat of terrorism.\n \tBut party leaders are well aware that he could leave the party, run as an independent and challenge the party's presidential nominee next year. It's a threat they have long feared.\n \tThe Republican Party, said Jeb Bush adviser Ana Navarro, is stuck between \"a rock and a jerk\" less than eight weeks before the first primary-season votes are cast in Iowa.\n \tRepublican National Committee member Henry Barbour said Trump's comments \"aren't worthy of someone who wants to occupy\" the White House. He said Trump would be a \"disaster politically\" for the party if he won the nomination.\n \tBarbour helped author the Republican National Committee's \"Growth and Opportunity Project\" after a painful 2012 presidential election that forced party leaders to re-evaluate their strategy in presidential contests to reflect the nation's demographic shifts. Among other things, the report cited an urgent need for Republican leaders to adopt an inclusive and welcoming tone on issues such as immigration.\n \tYet Trump has vaulted to the top of the Republican 2016 field by attacking immigrants in many cases. His continued popularity underscores the deep divide between Republican leaders and the party's conservative base, which holds outsized influence in the presidential nomination process.\n \tIndeed, Trump's plan was cheered during a South Carolina rally Monday evening, and vocal supporters across the country defended the Muslim ban as necessary for national security. Polling suggests the sentiment is likely fueled by sharp strain of xenophobia: A new AP-GfK poll found 8 in 10 Republicans think there are too many immigrants coming from the Middle East.\n \tTrump showed little concern for critics Tuesday.\n \t\"I don't care about them,\" he told CNN. \"I'm doing what's right.\"\n", :normalized_score_absolute=>29.38635, :normalized_score_relative=>4.003066026524697}, {:title=>"Donald Trump calls for 'complete shutdown' on Muslims entering U.S.", :url=>"http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/donald-trump-muslim-ban-1.3354606", :source=>"CBC", :score=>-0.392908, :type=>"negative", :content=>"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump called Monday for a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\"\u00A0\u2014\u00A0the most dramatic response yet by a candidate to last week's\u00A0shooting spree in San Bernardino, Calif., by what the FBI has called\u00A0a radicalized\u00A0couple.\nThe proposed ban would apply to immigrants and visitors alike, a sweeping prohibition affecting all adherents of Islam who want to come to the U.S.\u00A0The idea faced an immediate challenge to its legality and feasibility from experts who could point to no formal exclusion of immigrants based on religion in America's history.\nTrump's campaign said in a statement that such a ban should stand \"until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.\"\u00A0It said the proposal comes in response to a level of hatred among \"large segments of the Muslim population\" toward Americans.\n\"Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life,\" Trump said in the statement.\nAt an evening rally in South Carolina, Trump supporters cheered and shouted in support as he read his statement.

Its most popular presidential hopeful had gone far beyond the bounds of acceptable politics, core American values and basic human decency, by making a serious proposal to exclude an entire category of people from the United States based on their religious and ethnic\u00A0identity. \n The politics of racial exclusion, long banished from mainstream North American politics, had burst into the forefront of one of the world\u2019s largest and most influential political\u00A0parties. \n By Tuesday afternoon, it had become a problem for the entire United States. It was clear that Donald Trump\u2019s proposal to forbid people who identify themselves as Muslim from entering the United States, while quickly condemned by most politicians of the left, centre and right, had actually increased his popularity among Republican voters. A Bloomberg poll, taken on Tuesday, showed that of those who are likely to vote in the 2016 Republican primaries, 35 per cent approve of his proposal, and a similar number say they are therefore \u201Cmore likely to vote for\u00A0him.\u201D \n As pollster Frank Luntz, looking at similar numbers, concluded on Wednesday, \u201CYou actually have to consider the possibility of Trump winning the Republican nomination\u201D \u2013 that is, if the party is unable to expel or marginalize him, something its leaders were wary of considering this\u00A0week. \n The United States is discovering, very quickly, that a charismatic single-issue candidate whose single issue is bigotry and intolerance can attract significant support, and possibly even seize control of a major\u00A0party. \n True, Republican candidates have certainly used racially divisive language and trafficked in conspiracy theories about Latinos and Muslims. In the 2012 primaries, at least three candidates repeated a conspiracy theory about a secret plot by ordinary Muslim Americans to impose Sharia law by stealth. And this year, some of Mr. Trump\u2019s competitors have offered less radical versions of his fearmongering (such as denying citizenship to undocumented Latinos, or accepting only those Syrian refugees who are\u00A0Christian). \n But no mainstream candidate in recent history has used discrimination and racial fear not as a means to power but as an end in itself, as a chief policy\u00A0goal. \n In other words, Americans have learned that they have something in common with most countries in Europe, where a third-place opposition party devoted almost entirely to opposing racial and religious minorities has become a growing\u00A0fixture. \n Mr. Trump\u2019s rise to political fame, his positions, his public style, his singular focus on immigration and ethnicity and, most importantly, his supporters are strikingly similar to those of Europe\u2019s latest extreme-right firebrands: Marine Le Pen of France\u2019s National Front, Nigel Farage of Britain\u2019s UK Independence Party, Jimmie Akesson of the Sweden Democrats, Heinz-Christian Strache of Austria\u2019s Freedom Party and Geert Wilders of PVV in the Netherlands (who heartily endorsed the Muslim-banning proposal of his near-lookalike Mr.\u00A0Trump). \n Most of these parties have been slowly growing in size and popularity as the big social-democratic and Christian-democratic parties have withered, and while their supporters are nowhere near a majority in any country, in some places \u2013 notably Austria and France \u2013 they are edging into second-place\u00A0territory. \n Mr. Trump has plunged his country deep into this terrain, while simultaneously going further, with his Monday announcement, than almost any of these leaders\u00A0have. \n \u201CThe most amazing thing about Trump\u2019s latest statement, of not allowing any Muslims in, was that almost none of the European far-right parties would go that far,\u201D says Cas Mudde, a Dutch political scientist at the University of Georgia who analyzes anti-immigration political movements. \u201CThe only other party leader who\u2019s ever said that was Geert Wilders. I mean, Marine Le Pen hasn\u2019t made such statements, Strache hasn\u2019t \u2013 they\u2019ve always separated Islamism from Muslims. Trump went, within two months, from being a little bit critical of Islam to being among the most Islamophobic politicians in the\u00A0world.\u201D \n This poses two big challenges. One is for the Republican Party, which now faces an existential crisis. And one is for the wider U.S. political system, which needs to figure out how a large proportion of voters \u2013 possibly 15 or 20 per cent \u2013 became so angry and alienated that they would support the darkest form of intolerance, and whether it can find a way to direct those voters\u2019 anxieties into more moderate\u00A0politics. \n Both challenges rely on a key question: Just who are these people supporting Donald\u00A0Trump? \n THE DAWN OF THE\u00A0DISAFFECTEDS \n There is a genuine fear within Republican leadership and activist groups that Mr. Trump is going to tear the party in two. For he seems to have awakened a new group of voters whose aspirations are radically different from those of the Republican Party\u2019s traditional right\u00A0wing. \n \u201CThe phenomenon is real, and the danger Trump presents for the Republican Party is real,\u201D writes Ben Domenech, a Republican activist, publisher and former speechwriter in the administration of George W. Bush. \u201CHis statements have tapped into a widespread anger that has the potential to transform the Republican Party in significant ways. Ultimately, Trump presents a choice for the Republican Party about which path to follow: a path toward a coalition that is broad, classically liberal, and consistent with the party\u2019s history, or a path toward a coalition that is reduced to the narrow interests of identity politics for white\u00A0people.\u201D \n That shift toward \u201Cidentity politics for white people\u201D has created a new kind of Republican\u00A0voter. \n During the summer, it was commonplace for Republican activists, columnists and insiders to say that Mr. Trump\u2019s support would vanish come primary time: The people who were supporting him did not seem to be Republican voters. In fact, the people supporting him didn\u2019t seem to be coming from anywhere the party\u00A0recognized. \n An ABC News/Washington Post poll in late July found that Mr. Trump\u2019s strongest support came from \u201Cpeople at the margins of the Republican primary\u00A0process.\u201D \n Notably, it found that his support is four times higher among those with no postsecondary education (32 per cent of whom support him) than it is among university graduates. Polling at the end of November showed similar results, with Mr. Trump the favoured choice among voters without college degrees by a two-to-one margin over other\u00A0candidates. \n Equally surprising: On issues other than race and ethnicity, Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters don\u2019t tend to be especially right-wing. The ABC/Washington Post poll found that among very conservative voters, 17 per cent supported Mr. Trump; among somewhat conservative voters, 24 per cent did; and among moderate-to-liberal voters, 27 per cent\u00A0did. \n Republican activists have frequently noted that the core Trump supporters aren\u2019t coming from the GOP base; rather, they\u2019re part of a \u201Cwild card\u201D constituency, often alienated from mainstream politics, that votes Democratic or Republican \u2013 or, often, not at all. In its mammoth breakdown of American voting blocs, the Pew Research Center finds the group most likely to vote Trump is the community that it has variously labelled the \u201CDisaffecteds\u201D or, more recently, \u201CHard-Pressed\u00A0Skeptics.\u201D \n This group, representing between 9 and 13 per cent of the U.S. electorate, tends to be male (twice as many men as women today back Mr. Trump\u2019s politics), overwhelmingly white, and especially lacking in education: 7 in 10 of them have no postsecondary education, compared to 49 per cent\u00A0nationwide. \n As Pew\u2019s original, 2005 definition of the group read: \u201CDisaffecteds are only moderate supporters of government welfare and assistance to the poor. Strongly oppose immigration as well as regulatory and environmental policies on the grounds that government is ineffective and such measures cost jobs.\u201D Eighty per cent of them said immigrants \u201Care a burden on our country\u201D nearly double the rate of the general American\u00A0public. \n They don\u2019t tend to be staunch partisans: In 2005, 68 per cent of the disaffected group were registered Independents, and only 32 per cent were Republican. They tended to vote for Mr. Bush over John Kerry in 2004, then for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. By 2014, this group, defined slightly differently, was half Democratic and 37-per-cent Republican. Now they\u2019ve been captured by Mr.\u00A0Trump. \n Indeed, some observers say that the surprisingly strong turnout for overtly socialist Democratic Party candidate Bernie Sanders is coming from exactly the same constituency that\u2019s backing Mr. Trump. As the conservative writer Yuval Levin wrote in the National Review, \u201CBoth Trump and Sanders are calling attention to those political debates in which the inherent cosmopolitanism of modern capitalism is most deeply in tension with the inherent populism of modern democracy \u2013 especially, but by no means exclusively, immigration and\u00A0trade.\u201D \n It is perhaps easiest to understand the Disaffecteds as a case of failed integration. As the children and grandchildren of the old postwar U.S. white industrial working class, they have followed a trajectory, and fallen into ways of thinking, that are strikingly similar to those of some unsuccessful low-income immigrant groups in Europe: a low educational-attainment rate, lack of entrepreneurial success, reverse social mobility across generations, a tendency to self-segregate into ethnic enclaves and self-policed neighbourhoods, and, now, an increasing tendency to vote for extremist politics. They have not literally immigrated into America but rather have landed in a postindustrial, cosmopolitan economy, and resisted any effort to assimilate, instead choosing to turn against more successfully integrated American\u00A0newcomers. \n This alienated, white, generally male, older and undereducated constituency \u2013 perhaps 10 to 15 per cent of voters \u2013 has been driving the rise of new parties of the anti-minority right across the Western\u00A0world. \n Matthew Goodwin, a political scientist with Britain\u2019s Chatham House, has been analyzing the views and attitudes of people voting for anti-immigration parties across Europe and the United States. He says Mr. Trump\u2019s voters are strikingly similar to those backing far-right parties in the Netherlands, Britain or\u00A0Austria. \n \u201CWhat\u2019s most important is the role of anxiety, nostalgia and fears of cultural change among white Americans \u2013 especially white Americans who have not gone to university and have felt financially cut adrift from the transformation of their economy and have felt under threat from rapidly rising rates of ethnic diversity,\u201D Mr. Goodwin says. \u201CFor these people, this identity politics has become more influential than traditional issues such as jobs and\u00A0housing.\u201D \n Those voters didn\u2019t so much walk away from mainstream politics as find themselves abandoned by it. The big parties of the centre-left and the centre-right saw educated elites as their crucial constituency, and aimed for aspirational groups such as young university graduates and suburban soccer moms, who increasingly drove election outcomes. The lost low-education white voters simmered in the\u00A0background. \n Then, in the years after 2001, anti-immigration activists and people peddling anti-Muslim conspiracy theories discovered this\u00A0group. \n \u201CImmigration came up as a salient issue that cuts across that traditional party dividing line, and it became more important to working-class voters than the old left-right ideology,\u201D Dr. Goodwin says. \u201CAnd the parties failed to respond to that quickly enough because they were fixated on middle-class university graduates who were numerous enough that they decided the fate of elections. And the old working class, who used to decide elections in the sixties and seventies, became smaller in size, increasingly disenchanted and open to the appeals of the radical\u00A0right.\u201D \n Donald Trump, after countless false attempts to run for president (he has launched bids in almost every election), finally stumbled upon this group, and its singular obsession with immigrants and minorities, and seemed instinctively to see that they were unclaimed in American politics. Some of them had fallen into the racially intolerant branch of the Tea Party movement; others had stopped voting. His angry appeal to ethnic fear and white identity politics galvanized them, and turned them into what is, at the moment, the Republican Party\u2019s biggest\u00A0problem. \n For Reince Priebus, the former Tea Partier who chairs the Republican National Committee, this is the worst possible nightmare. After the dismal results of the 2012 presidential election, Mr. Priebus, along with most other Republican officials, recognized one of the new realities of U.S. political life: It is almost impossible to win the presidency if your party relies largely on the votes of white people. And in 2012, the Republicans received only 27 per cent of Hispanic votes and 6 per cent of African-American votes, a shortfall that analysts say cost them the\u00A0presidency. \n Mr. Priebus spent much of 2014 trying to raise his party\u2019s appeal to minority voters, boasting that he was spending about $8.5-million a month on outreach efforts. \u201CWhat I\u2019m saying is, instead of getting 6 per cent of the black vote in this country, if we get out there and fight and talk to people, then we get 15, then we get 20, and two years later we get 22 and 23. I\u2019m in this for the long haul,\u201D he said in a television interview last\u00A0year. \n And then along came Donald\u00A0Trump. \n In the wake of the real-estate mogul\u2019s sharp turn against Latin Americans \u2013 with his proposal a year ago to build a wall to keep immigrants out and to deport the 11 million full-time U.S. residents without citizenship \u2013 only 11 per cent of Hispanic Americans now support him. His African-American support was measured at 3 per cent in a recent CNN poll. And that\u2019s just the direct effect of Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy. Republican officials fear that a wider revulsion caused by his foray into the fringes of ethnic-resentment politics will drive larger numbers of people \u2013 notably religious and racial minorities \u2013 away from their\u00A0party. \n An even deeper fear is that Mr. Trump, if successful, will redefine the Republicans as a party built around the politics of racial\u00A0identity. \n There are, as the Republicans have long known, a lot of people who will come out to vote for \u201Cidentity politics for white people.\u201D But not anywhere close to a majority of Americans. The last time overtly racial-identity politics dominated the Republican Party, with the fire-breathing candidacy of Senator Barry Goldwater in 1964, the result was one of the most decisive defeats in presidential-election history, to Lyndon B. Johnson. Now, half a century later, there are a lot more minority voters, racial tolerance is vastly higher, and liberal Democrats are the fastest-growing political\u00A0constituency. \n That new reality was revealed starkly in an NBC-Wall Street Journal poll released on Thursday, which showed that 60 per cent of Americans have a \u201Cvery negative\u201D or \u201Cmostly negative\u201D view of Mr. Trump (and only about 12 per cent were \u201Cvery positive\u201D about him) \u2013 and that almost 65 per cent have a \u201Cvery favourable\u201D or \u201Cmostly favourable\u201D view of Muslims in their\u00A0country. \n The cheeky headline the Washington Post put on the poll, \u201CAmericans like Muslims more than they like Donald Trump,\u201D spells out the difficult decision faced by Mr. Priebus and his\u00A0colleagues. \n If Mr. Trump is allowed to prevail in the primaries, the Republicans\u2019 bid for the presidency is doomed \u2013 as, quite possibly, is the future of their party. But if they persuade him to leave the party or gaslight him out of the race \u2013 neither of which would be easy, as U.S. parties have no ability to oust members, and Mr. Trump is notoriously immune to influence or advice \u2013 then there\u2019s a good chance he will run as an independent, possibly taking his supporters and a good chunk of other Republicans with him. As Ross Perot showed in 1992 and Ralph Nader did in 2000, even a fairly minor third-party candidate can upset a presidential\u00A0race. \n Mr. Priebus dug himself deeper in August, when he forced all the party\u2019s candidates to sign a \u201Cloyalty pledge,\u201D in which they promise to support whichever candidate wins the primaries \u2013 and not to drop out and run a third-party campaign. Mr. Trump eagerly signed: It was intended to keep him from deserting, but it now means that the party is effectively stuck with\u00A0him. \n Faced with this dismal pair of options, the Republican leadership appears to have frozen in terror. When Mr. Priebus finally got around to responding to Mr. Trump\u2019s noxious proposal this week, his words were mild and passive. \u201CI don\u2019t agree,\u201D he said, \u201CWe need to aggressively take on radical Islamic terorrism but not at the expense of our American\u00A0values.\u201D \n And then, nothing. In the face of the greatest threat to its political survival, the party appears to have chosen to bide its time, and hope that Mr. Trump will finally do or say something that will diminish, rather than bolster, his\u00A0popularity. \n Mr. Trump is not going to become President of the United States. That prospect, in any imaginable scenario, would be utterly undone by the very things that make him appeal to a certain angry, ignored, white group of voters. His popularity among these excluded men is exactly what will prevent the much larger, more multihued, more moderate mainstream American electorate from considering him a viable presidential\u00A0candidate. \n But Mr. Trump will have a profound effect on American politics. That, after Monday night, is already taking place. Suddenly, that disaffected 10 or 15 per cent of voters are no longer a group to be ignored or addressed in coded dog-whistle appeals: It is a growing threat, and, for some, an\u00A0opportunity. \n Both moderate Republicans and Democrats are now searching for a new language with which to speak to this group \u2013 to appeal to its sense of exclusion and anxiety, with real economic solutions rather than myths of brown-skinned invaders \u2013 in hopes that their parties will never get trumped\u00A0again. \n Doug Saunders is The Globe and Mail\u2019s international affairs\u00A0columnist. \n", :normalized_score_absolute=>31.52685, :normalized_score_relative=>9.090530969244668}, {:title=>"Trump holds onto his lead among GOP voters after 'Muslim ban' comments with 35 per cent telling pollsters they support him", :url=>"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3357658/Donald-Trump-s-lead-Republican-voters-undiminished-poll-Muslim-comments.html", :source=>"Daily Mail", :score=>-0.200388, :type=>"negative", :content=>"By  Reuters   and  Belinda Robinson For Dailymail.com   \n\n\n   Published:   16:54 EST, 12 December 2015   |    Updated:   16:57 EST, 12 December 2015  \n\n\n\n\n\n", :normalized_score_absolute=>39.9806, :normalized_score_relative=>29.183105956172454}, {:title=>"Donald Trump scraps planned trip to Israel", :url=>"http://www.ctvnews.ca/world/donald-trump-scraps-planned-trip-to-israel-1.2694553", :source=>"CTV News", :score=>-0.107947, :type=>"negative", :content=>" \tWASHINGTON -- Republican Donald Trump has scrapped a planned trip to Israel, saying he will reschedule \"at a later date after I become President of the U.S.\"\n \tTrump tweeted Thursday that he is postponing the trip, which had become problematic for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

The United States, like most of the international community, refuses to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and says the city's status must be resolved in negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.\n \tTrump also made remarks that some said promoted Jewish stereotypes. \"I know why you're not going to support me: you're not going to support me because I don't want your money,\" Trump said. \"You want to control your own politician.\" He also said, \"I'm a negotiator, like you folks.\"\n", :normalized_score_absolute=>44.60265, :normalized_score_relative=>40.1686314588582}, {:title=>"Trump v Le Pen: In their own words", :url=>"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-35075439", :source=>"BBC", :score=>-0.0545557, :type=>"negative", :content=>"With Donald Trump and Marine Le Pen surging in the polls in the US and France, comparisons between the two politicians have been popping up all over the place.\n\"Donald Trump is now America's Marine Le Pen,\" declared a headline in the New Yorker this week. \n\"Europe has plenty of its own Donald Trumps,\" responded Marc Champion in BloombergView, noting that Le Pen may have a better chance of becoming president in France than Trump in the US.\nWhen it came to Donald Trump's call for a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the US\" Ms Le Pen asked a television interviewer: \"Seriously, have you ever heard me say something like that?\"\nOne answer could be that it depends on the definition of \"like\".\nHere is a comparison of quotations from the two politicians on this and other topics.\nTrump: Donald J Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on. We have no choice. We have no choice. We have no choice. (December 2015)\nLe Pen: Marine le Pen calls for an immediate end to all reception of migrants in France and an immediate end to their dispersal in the municipalities of France, both villages and towns. The security of the French people renders this precaution pressing. (November 2015 )\n(Trump was speaking after the San Bernardino shootings, and Le Pen after news that one of the Paris attackers entered Europe as a migrant.)\nTrump: When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending the best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us [sic]. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people. (June 2015)\nLe Pen: Would you accept 12 illegal immigrants moving into your flat? You would not. On top of that, they start to remove the wallpaper. Some of them would steal your wallet and brutalise your wife. You would not accept that. Consequently, we are welcoming, but we decide with whom we are welcoming. (May 2012)\nTrump: I will build a great wall - and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me - and I'll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words. (June 2015)\nLe Pen: Whatever the EU says, it is essential that France gets back control of its national borders once and for all. Without borders, neither defence nor security is possible. (November 2015)\nTrump: I will be the greatest representative of the Christians that they've had in a long time. (June 2015)\nLe Pen: Liberty, equality, fraternity are Christian values! France can be secular because it is Christian at its origin. (April 2012)\nTrump: I think that I would probably get along with him very well. And I don't think you'd be having the kind of problems that you're having right now. (October 2015)\nLe Pen: I admire his cool head because there's a Cold War being waged against him by the EU at the behest of the United States, which is defending its own interests. I admire that he's managed to restore pride and contentment to a great nation that's been humiliated and persecuted for 70 years. (January 2014)\nTrump: Obama thinks it's the number one problem of the world today. And I think it's very low on the list. So I am not a believer, and I will - unless somebody can prove something to me - I believe there's weather. I believe there's change, and I believe it goes up, and it goes down, and it goes up again. (September 2015)\nLe Pen: I am not sure that human activity is the principal origin of this phenomenon. (February 2012)\nTrump: Sadly, the American dream is dead. But if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again. (June 2015)\nLe Pen: There's something I will say: In the US, people are very patriotic. Their patriotism is obvious. In France, for many years, you had to fight to be patriotic. People are pushing us from loving our own country. (April 2015)\nTrump: I'm a free-trader. But the problem with free trade is you need really talented people to negotiate for you\u2026 Free trade can be wonderful if you have smart people, but we have people that are stupid. We have people that aren't smart. And we have people that are controlled by special interests. And it's just not going to work. (June 2015)\nLe Pen: Danger number one is two-faced. One, Islamic fundamentalism, which is a kind of totalitarianism in the 21st Century. The second is globalisation, which is another kind of totalitarianism, the ideology of free business with no boundaries. (April 2015)\nTrump: Nobody would be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump. Nobody. I will find \u2014 within our military - I will find the General Patton, or I will find General MacArthur. I will find the right guy. I will find the guy that's going to take that military and make it really work. Nobody, nobody will be pushing us around.  (June 2015)\nLe Pen: Bashar al-Assad leads Syria today, he leads an army, there is no other way if one wants to eradicate Islamic State than to join a large coalition including Bashar al-Assad\u2026 If I were president I would have done it three years ago. (October 2015)\nTrump: When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say, China in a trade deal? They kill us. I beat China all the time. All the time. (June 2015)\nLe Pen: All the big French groups chose China, where they undertake a large part of their production. There again, the focus on China for French production gave rise to one of the great unchallengeable dogmas of recent decades. The sun was supposed to be setting in France and rising in China. (August 2015)\nTrump: People are getting their heads chopped off, they're being drowned. Right now, they are far worse than they were, ever, under Saddam Hussein or Gaddafi. (October 2015)\nLe Pen: The fall of Saddam Hussein led to chaos in Iraq, which has become the home of jihadism. (February 2015)\nTrump: Well, the answer is yes, defund [ie stop government funding for the reproductive health non-profit organisation Planned Parenthood]. The other, [overturning the Supreme Court ruling Roe v Wade, which affirms a woman's right to an abortion] you need a lot of Supreme Court justices. But we're gonna be looking at that also very, very carefully. But you need a lot of Supreme Court judges. But defund, yes, we're going to be doing that. (December 2015)\nLe Pen: I am for freely available contraception and freely available abortion. (December 2015)\nTrump: I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created. I tell you that. I'll bring back our jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places. I'll bring back our jobs, and I'll bring back our money. (June 2015)\nLe Pen: Only the Front National plans to give back to France those essential weapons [such as control of its national budget and borders] to help it fight in a globalised world and achieve innovation and re-industrialisation.

I mean, everything I say he agrees with me, no matter what I say,\" Trump began. \"But with the ethanol, really, he's got to come a long way.\"\nHe added: \"If Ted Cruz is against ethanol, how does he win in Iowa? Because that's very anti-Iowa.\"\nTrump also appeared to take a veiled shot at Cruz's family background, suggesting Cruz might have trouble appealing to the state's evangelical voters. \"I do like Ted Cruz, but not a lot of evangelicals come out of Cuba,\" he said of the country where Cruz's father, an evangelical preacher, was born.\nThe attacks came after The New York Times reported that Cruz had questioned Trump's judgment at a closed-door fundraiser, straining the rare detente between two of the race's most outspoken candidates. Trump has gone after his other opponents gleefully and viciously, panning Jeb Bush as low-energy, Ben Carson as \"pathological\" and Marco Rubio as a lightweight who drinks too much water.\nBut the billionaire businessman had refrained from attacking Cruz, even as the Texas senator has surged in opinion polls, becoming Trump's most serious challenger in early-voting Iowa.\nCruz's campaign spokeswoman, Catherine Frazier, declined to comment on Trump's attacks.\nSeveral attendees at Trump's town hall event said in interviews before he spoke that they were torn between supporting Trump and Cruz, underscoring the risks each man faces going after the other too strongly.\nIndeed, Trump was relatively reserved in his criticism, repeatedly telling the crowd he liked Cruz.\nAsked at one point whether he would consider selecting Cruz as his running mate or nominating him to the Supreme Court, Trump was receptive.\n\"I would say that we would certainly have things in mind for Ted,\" he said.\nTrump took a new approach at the event at the Iowa State Fairgrounds, standing on a riser in the center of supporters, and speaking without a lectern.\nDuring his remarks, Trump stressed the importance of winning the state.\n\"If we win Iowa,\" he said, \"I think we're going to win everything after that.\"\n", :normalized_score_absolute=>50.01358655, :normalized_score_relative=>53.029154703617436}, {:title=>"Winnipeg mayor invites Donald Trump to city", :url=>"http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/12/11/winnipeg-mayor-invites-donald-trump-to-city.html", :source=>"The Star", :score=>0.353448, :type=>"positive", :content=>"\u201CI believe the reason for our tolerance, acceptance and desire to help comes from a deep understanding of other cultures,\u201D said Bowman, who came under scrutiny earlier this year after Winnipeg was labelled \u201Cthe most racist city in Canada\u201D for its treatment of indigenous people.\nWe value respectful and thoughtful discussion.
