This is the only way to deal with the militants in Syria.\n\"There\u2019s no point in meeting in New York or anywhere else without defining terrorist groups,\" he said. \"For us, in Syria, everyone who holds a machinegun is a terrorist.\"\nForeign ministers of countries opposed to Assad are due to meet in Paris on Monday to prepare for talks with Russia and Middle Eastern countries in New York on Thursday with a specific focus on trying to form the opposition delegation for the peace talks.\nBefore Assad's remarks were published, Washington said U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry would travel to Moscow on Tuesday for talks with President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.\nThe experience of a failed peace conference in Switzerland two years ago had kept expectations for the latest push low.\n\nDEMANDS THAT ASSAD LEAVE\nThe rebel groups issued a statement at the end of their two-day conference in Riyadh saying Assad should leave power at the start of a transitional period, and calling for an all-inclusive, democratic civic state.\nAlthough the demand goes beyond what Western powers are calling for, it is rejected by Assad's patrons Russia and Iran.\n                  A list of 34 members of a secretariat designated to select the opposition's negotiating team contained 11 representatives of rebel fighting groups, nine members of the exiled political opposition, six from Syria's internal opposition and eight independents.\nThe powerful Islamist insurgent group Ahrar al-Sham was represented, along with a number of FSA groups that have received military support from states opposed to Assad, such as Saudi Arabia and the United States.\nAt one point on Friday, Putin appeared to hold out an olive branch to the West, making what appeared to be Russia's first explicit statement of support for rebels opposed to Assad in the fight against Islamic State.\nAt an annual meeting at the Defence Ministry, he said the Free Syrian Army was engaged in \"offensive actions against terrorists, alongside regular forces, in the provinces of Homs, Hama, Aleppo and Raqqa\".\n\"We support it from the air, as well as the Syrian army, we assist them with weapons, ammunition and provide material support.\" he said.\nBut FSA groups dismissed any suggestion of Russian support.\nRussian air strikes have targeted a number of FSA groups in western Syria, notably factions that have received military support from Assad's foreign enemies, including anti-tank missiles. A senior Western diplomat said only about 20 percent of Russian strikes had been aimed at Islamic State.\n                  A few hours later, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to repeat Putin's assertion, saying: \"Russia supplies weapons to the legitimate authorities of the Syrian Arab Republic.\"\nAsked whether Putin had been talking about supplying FSA groups, he added: \"Please do not cling to meanings in this case. Such an interpretation is possible.\"\nThe U.S. State Department said on Friday it was unable to confirm Putin's claims. Spokesman John Kirby said, \"It's unclear to us ... whether these claims of support to the FSA are true.\" \n\nTRUCK BOMBS\nMeanwhile, Islamic State claimed a triple truck bomb attack that killed dozens of people in a part of northeastern Syria where Kurdish YPG forces have been pushing back the Islamist militants in recent weeks.\n                  The three blasts, carried out by at least two suicide bombers, went off outside a hospital, at a market and in a residential area in the town of Tel Tamer on Thursday night, the YPG's Redur Xelil said via an internet messaging service.\nHe put the toll at at least 50 dead and 80 wounded. The Asayish, a Kurdish internal security force, put the death toll at 26.\nThe YPG has been the most effective partner on the ground in Syria for the U.S.-led coalition that is pounding Islamic State from the air.\nBut it operates only in northern Syria, and is distrusted by other rebel groups, which shut it out of the Riyadh conference along with the al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, fighting alongside other rebels against Assad in western Syria.\nDifferences also remain between the groups that did attend, with many fighters considering Damascus-based political opposition figures to be too close to Assad - the same reason the YPG was excluded.\nBut the almost five-year-old conflict, in which more than 250,000 people have died, has also spawned unlikely alliances of convenience. \nTurkey's President Tayyip Erdogan said he would visit Saudi Arabia, a strong supporter of the anti-Assad rebels, soon.\n\"I will visit Saudi Arabia at the end of the month for an official visit and we will discuss a number of matters and join hands with Saudi Arabia with regard to the region's issues,\" he said in an interview with Al Jazeera.\nSenior U.S. Treasury Department official Adam Szubin said in London on Thursday that Islamic State had made more than $500 million selling oil from territory it controls, with significant volumes sold to Assad's government and some finding its way to Turkey.\nThe United Nations says the war has left 13.5 million Syrians in need of help and protection, including 400,000 living under siege and 4.5 million in areas that are hard for humanitarian assistance to reach.\nU.N.

Also in attendance were representatives of the Syria-based National Coordination Body, an organization sometimes accused by other opposition members of being too conciliatory toward Assad's government although several of its senior members are in prison.\nAhrar al-Sham said it faced \"a religious and national duty to withdraw from the conference to protest its outcome.\" Among the reasons it listed in its statement: \"Giving a principle role for the National Coordination Body and other personalities loyal to the regime in clear violation of revolutionary work.\"\nSpeaking at a news conference earlier on Thursday, Al-Jubeir said Assad has two choices, \"either to leave through negotiations\" or be forcibly removed from power.\nThe comments drew a sharp response from Syria's Information Minister Omran al-Zoubi in Damascus, who called al-Jubeir's statements a \"farce.\"\n\"You are too insignificant to talk about matters related to the Syrian people and Syrian state, I advise you to take care of issues your own size,\" he added.\nKaram reported from Beirut.

They\u2019re losing ground to absurd figures who used to be jokes, rabble-rousers, fringe players on the margins of political life. Who would have thought, a year ago, that serious people would be in such a panic over how to stop the likes of Marine Le Pen and Donald Trump?\nOver here, the appalling vulgarian has sucked up all the airtime, like some particularly virulent black hole. The more outrageous he gets, the higher his ratings soar. Mr. Trump degrades political debate. He poses a mortal threat to the Republican Party, which he airily dismisses as a gang of idiots. But they have no idea how to stop him.\nOver there, Ms. Le Pen and her ravishing young niece, Marion Mar\u00E9chal-Le Pen, have trampled the mainstream parties under their chic high heels. Last week their far-right anti-immigration, anti-Europe party, the National Front, won nearly 30 per cent of the vote in the first round of regional elections. Reaction in Europe ranged from fear to panic to outright horror. \u201CFrance\u2019s fascist uprising,\u201D blared Britain\u2019s Independent. Political columnist Fran\u00E7oise Fressoz wrote, \u201CThe political reality in France can now be summed up in one question. Who can stop Marine Le Pen?\u201D\nThe source of their appeal isn\u2019t hard to find. In both countries, the dominant political class has failed miserably to understand and address the anxieties of large numbers of middle-class people.\n\u201CDonald Trump says things no one else dares to say,\u201D his fans tell you. When he said the U.S. should deport its millions of illegal Mexican immigrants, they cheered. When he said Muslims should be banned from immigrating, the political and media class expressed universal horror. But in the fevered wake of the San Bernardino slaughter, many people thought: Why not? When a recent poll asked respondents if the values of Islam are incompatible with the American way of life, 76 per cent of Republicans answered yes. And 43 per cent of Democrats also answered yes.\nThat\u2019s the genius of Trumpism. There\u2019s Donald Trump \u2013 and then there\u2019s everybody else, yelling that he can\u2019t say that. That\u2019s why he\u2019s the Republican front-runner.\nPopulists come up with simplistic answers to complex questions \u2013 questions the elites would prefer not to address. Mr. Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant stance is purely opportunistic. But the utter failure of both Republicans and Democrats to tackle immigration reform in any meaningful way has left the field wide open.\nIt\u2019s the same with Marine Le Pen. People take to her because she stands up for ordinary folks \u2013 especially the rural and small-town folks, the young and unemployed folks, the folks who\u2019ve been hit hard by massive deindustrialization. Unlike Mr. Trump, she\u2019s not a flame-thrower. She comes across as moderate and reasoned. She\u2019s worked hard to scrub the party clean of its overtly racist past. But she, too, has been able to capitalize on the the mainstream parties\u2019 widespread failure to tackle France\u2019s serious economic and immigration woes.\nIt\u2019s fashionable to write off the people who respond to Mr. Trump and Ms. Le Pen as ignorant lowbrows, who can\u2019t adjust to modernity, to progress and to newcomers. That has been the standard response of the pundits and political elites. And that is a big part of the problem. The triumph of two of them has less to do with the baser instincts of the voters than with the incompetence of the current leadership. \u201C[Le Pen\u2019s] success is due to the failures and vacuum of the centre right, the weak conservatism of the Socialist Party, and the inability of the EU to respond to serious European challenges,\u201D The New York Times\u2019s Steven Erlanger told Carnegie Europe. Similarly, Mr. Trump\u2019s success is in large part due to the Republicans\u2019 inability to craft an appealing alternative to the Democrats. In both countries, many people don\u2019t see much difference among the old ruling parties. They\u2019re all part of the same old gang, and only a new outsider can bust them up.\nBoth Mr. Trump and Ms. LePen have profited hugely from the shock of domestic terrorism. But the unease they feed on is much deeper than that. \u201CThis sense of fury has a long history,\u201D wrote Alexis Brezet, editor of Le Figaro. \u201CIt is a cold, brutal, unsubtle, merciless fury. It has been brewed by 30 years of state weakness and government failures.\u201D People feel the values they hold dear are slipping away. Mr. Trump and Ms. Le Pen are promising to bring them back again.\nHow far will they go? My guess: The Republicans will rally round another champion and Donald Trump will probably be gone by March. (Whether he\u2019ll decide to run as an independent is anybody\u2019s guess. Hillary Clinton can only hope so.) Marine Le Pen won\u2019t go the distance either. Even so, their profound challenges to the old order aren\u2019t going to go away.

And that's about as diplomatic as I can be about it.\"\n \tOne by one, Republican officials across the country lashed out at Trump's plan, which calls for a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\" to help quell the threat of terrorism.\n \tBut party leaders are well aware that he could leave the party, run as an independent and challenge the party's presidential nominee next year. It's a threat they have long feared.\n \tThe Republican Party, said Jeb Bush adviser Ana Navarro, is stuck between \"a rock and a jerk\" less than eight weeks before the first primary-season votes are cast in Iowa.\n \tRepublican National Committee member Henry Barbour said Trump's comments \"aren't worthy of someone who wants to occupy\" the White House. He said Trump would be a \"disaster politically\" for the party if he won the nomination.\n \tBarbour helped author the Republican National Committee's \"Growth and Opportunity Project\" after a painful 2012 presidential election that forced party leaders to re-evaluate their strategy in presidential contests to reflect the nation's demographic shifts. Among other things, the report cited an urgent need for Republican leaders to adopt an inclusive and welcoming tone on issues such as immigration.\n \tYet Trump has vaulted to the top of the Republican 2016 field by attacking immigrants in many cases. His continued popularity underscores the deep divide between Republican leaders and the party's conservative base, which holds outsized influence in the presidential nomination process.\n \tIndeed, Trump's plan was cheered during a South Carolina rally Monday evening, and vocal supporters across the country defended the Muslim ban as necessary for national security. Polling suggests the sentiment is likely fueled by sharp strain of xenophobia: A new AP-GfK poll found 8 in 10 Republicans think there are too many immigrants coming from the Middle East.\n \tTrump showed little concern for critics Tuesday.\n \t\"I don't care about them,\" he told CNN. \"I'm doing what's right.\"\n", :normalized_score_absolute=>29.38635, :normalized_score_relative=>4.003066026524697}, {:title=>"Donald Trump calls for 'complete shutdown' on Muslims entering U.S.", :url=>"http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/donald-trump-muslim-ban-1.3354606", :source=>"CBC", :score=>-0.392908, :type=>"negative", :content=>"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump called Monday for a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\"\u00A0\u2014\u00A0the most dramatic response yet by a candidate to last week's\u00A0shooting spree in San Bernardino, Calif., by what the FBI has called\u00A0a radicalized\u00A0couple.\nThe proposed ban would apply to immigrants and visitors alike, a sweeping prohibition affecting all adherents of Islam who want to come to the U.S.\u00A0The idea faced an immediate challenge to its legality and feasibility from experts who could point to no formal exclusion of immigrants based on religion in America's history.\nTrump's campaign said in a statement that such a ban should stand \"until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.\"\u00A0It said the proposal comes in response to a level of hatred among \"large segments of the Muslim population\" toward Americans.\n\"Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life,\" Trump said in the statement.\nAt an evening rally in South Carolina, Trump supporters cheered and shouted in support as he read his statement.

Its most popular presidential hopeful had gone far beyond the bounds of acceptable politics, core American values and basic human decency, by making a serious proposal to exclude an entire category of people from the United States based on their religious and ethnic\u00A0identity. \n The politics of racial exclusion, long banished from mainstream North American politics, had burst into the forefront of one of the world\u2019s largest and most influential political\u00A0parties. \n By Tuesday afternoon, it had become a problem for the entire United States. It was clear that Donald Trump\u2019s proposal to forbid people who identify themselves as Muslim from entering the United States, while quickly condemned by most politicians of the left, centre and right, had actually increased his popularity among Republican voters. A Bloomberg poll, taken on Tuesday, showed that of those who are likely to vote in the 2016 Republican primaries, 35 per cent approve of his proposal, and a similar number say they are therefore \u201Cmore likely to vote for\u00A0him.\u201D \n As pollster Frank Luntz, looking at similar numbers, concluded on Wednesday, \u201CYou actually have to consider the possibility of Trump winning the Republican nomination\u201D \u2013 that is, if the party is unable to expel or marginalize him, something its leaders were wary of considering this\u00A0week. \n The United States is discovering, very quickly, that a charismatic single-issue candidate whose single issue is bigotry and intolerance can attract significant support, and possibly even seize control of a major\u00A0party. \n True, Republican candidates have certainly used racially divisive language and trafficked in conspiracy theories about Latinos and Muslims. In the 2012 primaries, at least three candidates repeated a conspiracy theory about a secret plot by ordinary Muslim Americans to impose Sharia law by stealth. And this year, some of Mr. Trump\u2019s competitors have offered less radical versions of his fearmongering (such as denying citizenship to undocumented Latinos, or accepting only those Syrian refugees who are\u00A0Christian). \n But no mainstream candidate in recent history has used discrimination and racial fear not as a means to power but as an end in itself, as a chief policy\u00A0goal. \n In other words, Americans have learned that they have something in common with most countries in Europe, where a third-place opposition party devoted almost entirely to opposing racial and religious minorities has become a growing\u00A0fixture. \n Mr. Trump\u2019s rise to political fame, his positions, his public style, his singular focus on immigration and ethnicity and, most importantly, his supporters are strikingly similar to those of Europe\u2019s latest extreme-right firebrands: Marine Le Pen of France\u2019s National Front, Nigel Farage of Britain\u2019s UK Independence Party, Jimmie Akesson of the Sweden Democrats, Heinz-Christian Strache of Austria\u2019s Freedom Party and Geert Wilders of PVV in the Netherlands (who heartily endorsed the Muslim-banning proposal of his near-lookalike Mr.\u00A0Trump). \n Most of these parties have been slowly growing in size and popularity as the big social-democratic and Christian-democratic parties have withered, and while their supporters are nowhere near a majority in any country, in some places \u2013 notably Austria and France \u2013 they are edging into second-place\u00A0territory. \n Mr. Trump has plunged his country deep into this terrain, while simultaneously going further, with his Monday announcement, than almost any of these leaders\u00A0have. \n \u201CThe most amazing thing about Trump\u2019s latest statement, of not allowing any Muslims in, was that almost none of the European far-right parties would go that far,\u201D says Cas Mudde, a Dutch political scientist at the University of Georgia who analyzes anti-immigration political movements. \u201CThe only other party leader who\u2019s ever said that was Geert Wilders. I mean, Marine Le Pen hasn\u2019t made such statements, Strache hasn\u2019t \u2013 they\u2019ve always separated Islamism from Muslims. Trump went, within two months, from being a little bit critical of Islam to being among the most Islamophobic politicians in the\u00A0world.\u201D \n This poses two big challenges. One is for the Republican Party, which now faces an existential crisis. And one is for the wider U.S. political system, which needs to figure out how a large proportion of voters \u2013 possibly 15 or 20 per cent \u2013 became so angry and alienated that they would support the darkest form of intolerance, and whether it can find a way to direct those voters\u2019 anxieties into more moderate\u00A0politics. \n Both challenges rely on a key question: Just who are these people supporting Donald\u00A0Trump? \n THE DAWN OF THE\u00A0DISAFFECTEDS \n There is a genuine fear within Republican leadership and activist groups that Mr. Trump is going to tear the party in two. For he seems to have awakened a new group of voters whose aspirations are radically different from those of the Republican Party\u2019s traditional right\u00A0wing. \n \u201CThe phenomenon is real, and the danger Trump presents for the Republican Party is real,\u201D writes Ben Domenech, a Republican activist, publisher and former speechwriter in the administration of George W. Bush. \u201CHis statements have tapped into a widespread anger that has the potential to transform the Republican Party in significant ways. Ultimately, Trump presents a choice for the Republican Party about which path to follow: a path toward a coalition that is broad, classically liberal, and consistent with the party\u2019s history, or a path toward a coalition that is reduced to the narrow interests of identity politics for white\u00A0people.\u201D \n That shift toward \u201Cidentity politics for white people\u201D has created a new kind of Republican\u00A0voter. \n During the summer, it was commonplace for Republican activists, columnists and insiders to say that Mr. Trump\u2019s support would vanish come primary time: The people who were supporting him did not seem to be Republican voters. In fact, the people supporting him didn\u2019t seem to be coming from anywhere the party\u00A0recognized. \n An ABC News/Washington Post poll in late July found that Mr. Trump\u2019s strongest support came from \u201Cpeople at the margins of the Republican primary\u00A0process.\u201D \n Notably, it found that his support is four times higher among those with no postsecondary education (32 per cent of whom support him) than it is among university graduates. Polling at the end of November showed similar results, with Mr. Trump the favoured choice among voters without college degrees by a two-to-one margin over other\u00A0candidates. \n Equally surprising: On issues other than race and ethnicity, Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters don\u2019t tend to be especially right-wing. The ABC/Washington Post poll found that among very conservative voters, 17 per cent supported Mr. Trump; among somewhat conservative voters, 24 per cent did; and among moderate-to-liberal voters, 27 per cent\u00A0did. \n Republican activists have frequently noted that the core Trump supporters aren\u2019t coming from the GOP base; rather, they\u2019re part of a \u201Cwild card\u201D constituency, often alienated from mainstream politics, that votes Democratic or Republican \u2013 or, often, not at all. In its mammoth breakdown of American voting blocs, the Pew Research Center finds the group most likely to vote Trump is the community that it has variously labelled the \u201CDisaffecteds\u201D or, more recently, \u201CHard-Pressed\u00A0Skeptics.\u201D \n This group, representing between 9 and 13 per cent of the U.S. electorate, tends to be male (twice as many men as women today back Mr. Trump\u2019s politics), overwhelmingly white, and especially lacking in education: 7 in 10 of them have no postsecondary education, compared to 49 per cent\u00A0nationwide. \n As Pew\u2019s original, 2005 definition of the group read: \u201CDisaffecteds are only moderate supporters of government welfare and assistance to the poor. Strongly oppose immigration as well as regulatory and environmental policies on the grounds that government is ineffective and such measures cost jobs.\u201D Eighty per cent of them said immigrants \u201Care a burden on our country\u201D nearly double the rate of the general American\u00A0public. \n They don\u2019t tend to be staunch partisans: In 2005, 68 per cent of the disaffected group were registered Independents, and only 32 per cent were Republican. They tended to vote for Mr. Bush over John Kerry in 2004, then for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. By 2014, this group, defined slightly differently, was half Democratic and 37-per-cent Republican. Now they\u2019ve been captured by Mr.\u00A0Trump. \n Indeed, some observers say that the surprisingly strong turnout for overtly socialist Democratic Party candidate Bernie Sanders is coming from exactly the same constituency that\u2019s backing Mr. Trump. As the conservative writer Yuval Levin wrote in the National Review, \u201CBoth Trump and Sanders are calling attention to those political debates in which the inherent cosmopolitanism of modern capitalism is most deeply in tension with the inherent populism of modern democracy \u2013 especially, but by no means exclusively, immigration and\u00A0trade.\u201D \n It is perhaps easiest to understand the Disaffecteds as a case of failed integration. As the children and grandchildren of the old postwar U.S. white industrial working class, they have followed a trajectory, and fallen into ways of thinking, that are strikingly similar to those of some unsuccessful low-income immigrant groups in Europe: a low educational-attainment rate, lack of entrepreneurial success, reverse social mobility across generations, a tendency to self-segregate into ethnic enclaves and self-policed neighbourhoods, and, now, an increasing tendency to vote for extremist politics. They have not literally immigrated into America but rather have landed in a postindustrial, cosmopolitan economy, and resisted any effort to assimilate, instead choosing to turn against more successfully integrated American\u00A0newcomers. \n This alienated, white, generally male, older and undereducated constituency \u2013 perhaps 10 to 15 per cent of voters \u2013 has been driving the rise of new parties of the anti-minority right across the Western\u00A0world. \n Matthew Goodwin, a political scientist with Britain\u2019s Chatham House, has been analyzing the views and attitudes of people voting for anti-immigration parties across Europe and the United States. He says Mr. Trump\u2019s voters are strikingly similar to those backing far-right parties in the Netherlands, Britain or\u00A0Austria. \n \u201CWhat\u2019s most important is the role of anxiety, nostalgia and fears of cultural change among white Americans \u2013 especially white Americans who have not gone to university and have felt financially cut adrift from the transformation of their economy and have felt under threat from rapidly rising rates of ethnic diversity,\u201D Mr. Goodwin says. \u201CFor these people, this identity politics has become more influential than traditional issues such as jobs and\u00A0housing.\u201D \n Those voters didn\u2019t so much walk away from mainstream politics as find themselves abandoned by it. The big parties of the centre-left and the centre-right saw educated elites as their crucial constituency, and aimed for aspirational groups such as young university graduates and suburban soccer moms, who increasingly drove election outcomes. The lost low-education white voters simmered in the\u00A0background. \n Then, in the years after 2001, anti-immigration activists and people peddling anti-Muslim conspiracy theories discovered this\u00A0group. \n \u201CImmigration came up as a salient issue that cuts across that traditional party dividing line, and it became more important to working-class voters than the old left-right ideology,\u201D Dr. Goodwin says. \u201CAnd the parties failed to respond to that quickly enough because they were fixated on middle-class university graduates who were numerous enough that they decided the fate of elections. And the old working class, who used to decide elections in the sixties and seventies, became smaller in size, increasingly disenchanted and open to the appeals of the radical\u00A0right.\u201D \n Donald Trump, after countless false attempts to run for president (he has launched bids in almost every election), finally stumbled upon this group, and its singular obsession with immigrants and minorities, and seemed instinctively to see that they were unclaimed in American politics. Some of them had fallen into the racially intolerant branch of the Tea Party movement; others had stopped voting. His angry appeal to ethnic fear and white identity politics galvanized them, and turned them into what is, at the moment, the Republican Party\u2019s biggest\u00A0problem. \n For Reince Priebus, the former Tea Partier who chairs the Republican National Committee, this is the worst possible nightmare. After the dismal results of the 2012 presidential election, Mr. Priebus, along with most other Republican officials, recognized one of the new realities of U.S. political life: It is almost impossible to win the presidency if your party relies largely on the votes of white people. And in 2012, the Republicans received only 27 per cent of Hispanic votes and 6 per cent of African-American votes, a shortfall that analysts say cost them the\u00A0presidency. \n Mr. Priebus spent much of 2014 trying to raise his party\u2019s appeal to minority voters, boasting that he was spending about $8.5-million a month on outreach efforts. \u201CWhat I\u2019m saying is, instead of getting 6 per cent of the black vote in this country, if we get out there and fight and talk to people, then we get 15, then we get 20, and two years later we get 22 and 23. I\u2019m in this for the long haul,\u201D he said in a television interview last\u00A0year. \n And then along came Donald\u00A0Trump. \n In the wake of the real-estate mogul\u2019s sharp turn against Latin Americans \u2013 with his proposal a year ago to build a wall to keep immigrants out and to deport the 11 million full-time U.S. residents without citizenship \u2013 only 11 per cent of Hispanic Americans now support him. His African-American support was measured at 3 per cent in a recent CNN poll. And that\u2019s just the direct effect of Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy. Republican officials fear that a wider revulsion caused by his foray into the fringes of ethnic-resentment politics will drive larger numbers of people \u2013 notably religious and racial minorities \u2013 away from their\u00A0party. \n An even deeper fear is that Mr. Trump, if successful, will redefine the Republicans as a party built around the politics of racial\u00A0identity. \n There are, as the Republicans have long known, a lot of people who will come out to vote for \u201Cidentity politics for white people.\u201D But not anywhere close to a majority of Americans. The last time overtly racial-identity politics dominated the Republican Party, with the fire-breathing candidacy of Senator Barry Goldwater in 1964, the result was one of the most decisive defeats in presidential-election history, to Lyndon B. Johnson. Now, half a century later, there are a lot more minority voters, racial tolerance is vastly higher, and liberal Democrats are the fastest-growing political\u00A0constituency. \n That new reality was revealed starkly in an NBC-Wall Street Journal poll released on Thursday, which showed that 60 per cent of Americans have a \u201Cvery negative\u201D or \u201Cmostly negative\u201D view of Mr. Trump (and only about 12 per cent were \u201Cvery positive\u201D about him) \u2013 and that almost 65 per cent have a \u201Cvery favourable\u201D or \u201Cmostly favourable\u201D view of Muslims in their\u00A0country. \n The cheeky headline the Washington Post put on the poll, \u201CAmericans like Muslims more than they like Donald Trump,\u201D spells out the difficult decision faced by Mr. Priebus and his\u00A0colleagues. \n If Mr. Trump is allowed to prevail in the primaries, the Republicans\u2019 bid for the presidency is doomed \u2013 as, quite possibly, is the future of their party. But if they persuade him to leave the party or gaslight him out of the race \u2013 neither of which would be easy, as U.S. parties have no ability to oust members, and Mr. Trump is notoriously immune to influence or advice \u2013 then there\u2019s a good chance he will run as an independent, possibly taking his supporters and a good chunk of other Republicans with him. As Ross Perot showed in 1992 and Ralph Nader did in 2000, even a fairly minor third-party candidate can upset a presidential\u00A0race. \n Mr. Priebus dug himself deeper in August, when he forced all the party\u2019s candidates to sign a \u201Cloyalty pledge,\u201D in which they promise to support whichever candidate wins the primaries \u2013 and not to drop out and run a third-party campaign. Mr. Trump eagerly signed: It was intended to keep him from deserting, but it now means that the party is effectively stuck with\u00A0him. \n Faced with this dismal pair of options, the Republican leadership appears to have frozen in terror. When Mr. Priebus finally got around to responding to Mr. Trump\u2019s noxious proposal this week, his words were mild and passive. \u201CI don\u2019t agree,\u201D he said, \u201CWe need to aggressively take on radical Islamic terorrism but not at the expense of our American\u00A0values.\u201D \n And then, nothing. In the face of the greatest threat to its political survival, the party appears to have chosen to bide its time, and hope that Mr. Trump will finally do or say something that will diminish, rather than bolster, his\u00A0popularity. \n Mr. Trump is not going to become President of the United States. That prospect, in any imaginable scenario, would be utterly undone by the very things that make him appeal to a certain angry, ignored, white group of voters. His popularity among these excluded men is exactly what will prevent the much larger, more multihued, more moderate mainstream American electorate from considering him a viable presidential\u00A0candidate. \n But Mr. Trump will have a profound effect on American politics. That, after Monday night, is already taking place. Suddenly, that disaffected 10 or 15 per cent of voters are no longer a group to be ignored or addressed in coded dog-whistle appeals: It is a growing threat, and, for some, an\u00A0opportunity. \n Both moderate Republicans and Democrats are now searching for a new language with which to speak to this group \u2013 to appeal to its sense of exclusion and anxiety, with real economic solutions rather than myths of brown-skinned invaders \u2013 in hopes that their parties will never get trumped\u00A0again. \n Doug Saunders is The Globe and Mail\u2019s international affairs\u00A0columnist. \n", :normalized_score_absolute=>31.52685, :normalized_score_relative=>9.090530969244668}, {:title=>"Trump holds onto his lead among GOP voters after 'Muslim ban' comments with 35 per cent telling pollsters they support him", :url=>"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3357658/Donald-Trump-s-lead-Republican-voters-undiminished-poll-Muslim-comments.html", :source=>"Daily Mail", :score=>-0.200388, :type=>"negative", :content=>"By  Reuters   and  Belinda Robinson For Dailymail.com   \n\n\n   Published:   16:54 EST, 12 December 2015   |    Updated:   16:57 EST, 12 December 2015  \n\n\n\n\n\n", :normalized_score_absolute=>39.9806, :normalized_score_relative=>29.183105956172454}, {:title=>"Donald Trump scraps planned trip to Israel", :url=>"http://www.ctvnews.ca/world/donald-trump-scraps-planned-trip-to-israel-1.2694553", :source=>"CTV News", :score=>-0.107947, :type=>"negative", :content=>" \tWASHINGTON -- Republican Donald Trump has scrapped a planned trip to Israel, saying he will reschedule \"at a later date after I become President of the U.S.\"\n \tTrump tweeted Thursday that he is postponing the trip, which had become problematic for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

The problem is that the site\u2019s whole raison d'\u00EAtre is based on optimistic networking and that eventually involves being contacted or interacting with unknown users. Without that dimension most LinkedIn users' contact lists would barely stretch beyond 50 at most. Compounding this is that even trustworthy contracts can create weaknesses. The fact that you trust or personally know a fellow LinkedIn user doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t themselves accept a request from someone dubious, potentially opening a gateway for you to receive scam InMail depending on your account security and privacy settings.\nLinkedIn scams \u2013 be incredibly careful about invitations\nLinkedIn threats can be divided into two types: Bogus connection requests from fake users within the service and Email phishing attacks outside LinkedIn that pretend to be connection confirmations. It\u2019s tempting to see attacks outside the service as less of a concern but remember how the service works \u2013 people send out connection requests and by default these are forwarded to the registered email address. People get used to clicking on them and therein lies the threat.\nWebmail services will normally filter LinkedIn phishing emails but one way to identify them is to hover the mouse cursor over the blue \u2018confirmation\u2019 box LinkedIn embeds inside requests and study the web address. Anything that begins \u2018https://www.linkedin.com\u2019 is probably fine. However, a better approach is simply NEVER to accept connection requests from outside LinkedIn, period. Always log on to the service and vet them first.\nEven within LinkedIn, a common technique is to use fake recruiters \u2013 security companies regularly document these types of attack. Anyone with more than a few hundred LinkedIn contacts probably has one or two of these bogus accounts hiding within their contact list. The point of these attacks is to persuade a few people to connect to them, which makes them look more legitimate to others as they spread. They also use acceptance as a way to scan for additional and possibly higher-value contacts.\nLinkedIn scams - get to know LinkedIn\u2019s privacy settings\nThe simplest way to avoid the scammers is to become less visible using the service\u2019s Privacy Controls. Unfortunately, LinkedIn can quickly turn into a privacy labyrinth. The first setting to look for is \u2018who can send you invitations\u2019 (under Privacy Settings > Communications tab). The three options here are \u2018anyone on LinkedIn\u2019 which is recommended but where problems start. The alternatives are only people who already know your email address or appear on an imported contacts list.\nThe second setting is to specify the types of messages you\u2019re willing to receive under the same tab. One way of filtering out some of the recruitments scammers is to uncheck the \u2018career opportunities\u2019 and \u2018new ventures\u2019 boxes.\nOne of the purposes of malicious accounts is to spread and that is achieved by studying a user\u2019s own connections. Stopping that means configuring it so that only you can see your connections (Privacy Controls > choose who can see your connections). You might also have to turn off the visibility of endorsements.\nSymantec\u2019s current advice is this: \u201CIf you\u2019ve never met the person before, don\u2019t just add them.\u201D That strikes us as completely unrealistic. The better approach is to be discerning and set some criteria for who is accepted and who is not. This also requires actually visiting and studying the profile of anyone asking to connect. LinkedIn is supposed to be about quality, not quantity. Unfortunately, some users persist and seeing this kind of networking as a measure of popularity or importance \u2013 bad idea.\nThe final judgment about fake connection request is simply noticing that they are fakes. This isn\u2019t as hard as it sounds. A recent warning put out by Symantec offers good examples of the common elements that often mark fake connections out. These include:\nGeneric photographs \nImage of people or logos that look as if they\u2019ve been lifted. Symantec recommends using a reverse image search (Google\u2019s search by image) to check out origins. Images of young women are a favourite.\nKeyword stuffing \nDepending on the type of fake account, scammers will always fill text with the sorts of SEO terms few real users would ever use. There will often be a lot.\nA small number of connections\nLinkedIn eventually spots fake accounts and closes them \u2013 scammers will almost always have only a single-digit numbers of connections. Ask yourself: why would someone you\u2019ve never heard of request a connection despite being connected to few other people?\nIncomplete profile\nWhole sections of bogus profiles will be blank. Genuine connections rarely enter information in this way. Others sections will read as if they\u2019ve been be cut and pasted form elsewhere, employing a generic writing style with misspellings.\nLinkedIn offers a simple way to report suspicious connection requests from within the service. In the connection \u2018send a message\u2019 drop down box on a user\u2019s profile page, it is possible to block or report a LinkedIn user based on the following policy: \u201CThis person will be submitted for review. We'll look for inappropriate behavior or violations of our Terms of Use.

Actually, I said it twice. Once to my wife, and once again a few days later to a colleague. I said so because they kept suggesting that I should use the social media website in my job search. I had never encountered a problem finding a job before, and I had never used LinkedIn. Why start now? Well, this article will reflect my complete change of opinion on LinkedIn. I now think that it is an invaluable service to both job seekers and talent seekers, and that LinkedIn will actually still be here long after Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter's (NYSE:TWTR) popularity have run their course.\nSince my dark days of job seeking and networking ignorance, I have become a devout LinkedIn believer. Twice (in three years) I have used the website's premium services to find a job, and both times it took me less than two months to do so. My most recent LinkedIn job seeking experience not only helped me find a job quickly, it helped me negotiate a 30% bump in pay. Not bad for about $40's worth of LinkedIn premium!\nThe value a job seeker gets with LinkedIn premium is unbelievable. For $20 a month, I got direct access to the job poster, detailed information about my competition's qualifications, and how I ranked amongst them. There is no bigger confidence booster than finding a job posting you are really excited about and seeing that LinkedIn's algorithm places you within the top 10% of applicants. This incredible &quot;insider&quot; information made me confident when applying, when interviewing, and perhaps most importantly, when negotiating a salary. Talent seekers also benefit tremendously from LinkedIn's network of 400 million users. Not only can you post jobs that will be sent out as e-mailed or website alerts to people in the field you're looking for, you can also research and directly recruit the top talent in your field.\nBut if LinkedIn is so awesome, where is all of the &quot;buzz&quot; around them and their stock? They can't possibly be growing as much as Facebook and Twitter, because we just don't hear enough about them, right? Wrong. In fact, while LinkedIn might not be as sexy as their other social media counterparts, their performance has been just as impressive. LinkedIn's management has done an incredible job growing revenue at an impressive annual average of 63% over the past four years. This performance is not news to &quot;smart money&quot;, as institutional investors have gobbled up shares to the tune of 90% of LinkedIn's outstanding stock. Compare this to the 69% of institutional investment in Facebook, and 46% in Twitter, and you get an idea of which company institutions are most confident in.\nSource: Google Finance\nAs a result of management's success in growing revenue, shareholders have been handsomely rewarded with 148% in capital gains since the stock had its initial public offering back in 2011; this is a great premium from the Dow Jones' 38% return during the same timeframe. LinkedIn's return on investment had actually been greater than the return seen by both Facebook and Twitter investors until mid 2015, when Facebook finally surpassed LinkedIn's capital gain returns by about 20%.\n(click to enlarge)\nSource: Google Finance\nIf you are not impressed yet, I have another number that might just convince you. While it is true that LinkedIn has the least monthly active users (100M) when compared to Facebook (1.55B) and Twitter (320M), it has a far greater capability of generating earnings per active user. This means that LNKD does not have to attract nearly as many users to generate the type of revenue that Facebook is generating.\nSource: LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter Company Websites\nWhile we have established that LinkedIn has a strong management team with a successful growth record, and that LinkedIn has a much more powerful ability to generate revenue per active users than Facebook does, the market still assigns a larger revenue multiplier to Facebook's market cap (23x) than it does to LinkedIn's (14x). Given what we have discussed so far, I feel that this valuation discrepancy is unwarranted. If this is corrected, and LinkedIn is assigned the same revenue multiplier that the market is assigning to Facebook, LinkedIn's market cap would rise from $29.94B to $50.6B, a near 70% jump in value.\nSource: Google Finance\nThe cherry on the cake for LinkedIn investors is the fact that LinkedIn's business model is significantly more recession proof than Facebook and Twitter's business models. Facebook and Twitter rely heavily on revenue from advertisers, and these advertisers might be forced to cut back during economic downturns, hurting these companies' ability to increase shareholder value in a poor economic environment. LinkedIn's revenue streams are more diversified, protecting its investors during poor economies. The beauty here is that LinkedIn effectively &quot;triple dips&quot; into its user pool, generating income from advertisements, from companies seeking applicants, and from applicants seeking new job opportunities. This can best be explained by the below chart found on the company's website:\nSource: LinkedIn Website\nThe greatest part of the above revenue streams is that they are fluid, varying in size as the economic situation changes. Since we have had a good economic environment in the past few years, it makes sense that the chart currently shows more revenue from firms seeking applicants (talent solutions) than from applicants seeking jobs (premium subscriptions). As the economy ebbs and flows, this revenue distribution would change to reflect the current demand vs. supply of jobs. In a recessionary environment, we would likely see a bigger portion of LinkedIn's revenue coming from premium subscriptions from users seeking jobs than from employers seeking talent solutions, but the overall revenue generated would not be as greatly impacted as the revenue generated by Twitter and Facebook during the same poor economic environment.\nLinkedIn's Secret Weapon: A Significant Change in Societal Norms in Regards to Employment Length\nI bet you like what you have heard so far, but it gets better! Thankfully for LinkedIn and its investors, there is an important new generational norm that will keep their business model useful (and profitable) for decades to come. The two generations that are about to become the most prevalent in our workforce (as the last of the boomers retire), Generation X and Millennials, change jobs almost as often as they change clothes. This new norm is outlined quite nicely in an Entrepreneur article by Doug and Polly White. Their article claims that Generation Xers change jobs every three to five years, while Millennials change jobs even more frequently. Their claim is supported by a recent &quot;Employee Tenure Summary&quot; by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Out of their report came this very telling paragraph:\nSource: Bureau of Labor Statistics\nAs frequent job changes become the societal norm, LinkedIn's services become invaluable for these two generations of workers. LinkedIn allows them to network and stay connected with past and current colleagues, post articles that outline their strengths and level of understanding of their fields, and introduce themselves to possible employers. As an added bonus, they can do all of this in a social network-like environment, which is an environment that they are very comfortable in thanks to Facebook and Twitter.\nWe have already established that LinkedIn's business model is more likely to do well in a poor economic environment than both Twitter and Facebook's. But, as with any other service, there is always the risk of other market entrants spoiling the party. A fellow Seeking Alpha contributor mentioned in a recent article that Facebook might decide to compete with LinkedIn by allowing users to share their resumes on their platform. This was in fact rumored in 2014, and should be something that is on LinkedIn's radar.\nSince Facebook already has 1.5 billion active monthly users, their entry in this segment would seem significant, but I personally do not believe that Facebook would be able to take away LinkedIn's dominance. My first argument is that Facebook users would be concerned about what their prospective/current employers would be able to learn about their personal lives through such a service, and they would actually prefer to use a completely different website (like LinkedIn) for their job seeking efforts. Secondly, LinkedIn has already built an entire professional networking environment that would be hard to emulate. Facebook would essentially have to start building such a community from scratch, and there is no guarantee that they would be as successful in doing so as LinkedIn has. For these reasons, I believe LinkedIn's dominance in its field is safe, at least for a few more years.\nIt is easy to see how our new societal norm of frequently changing jobs, combined with LinkedIn's effective management and recession proof business model has made the company so attractive to institutional buyers. Because of these important qualities, and its relatively small user base compared to Facebook and Twitter, I think LinkedIn will be experiencing significant growth in the years ahead, free of significant competition from any other large social media player.\n", :normalized_score_absolute=>68.548, :normalized_score_relative=>52.45960260128623}, {:title=>"Mario Creates a LinkedIn Account", :url=>"http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/15/mario-creates-a-linkedin-account", :source=>"IGN", :score=>0.49034, :type=>"positive", :content=>"                     He's got great experience.                \n                                                                                                            By Matt Porter                                                                                                   \nIt seems that Mario has joined &quot;400 million other professionals&quot; by creating a LinkedIn profile.\n&quot;For the past thirty five years I have been a proud Italian-American plumber who, along with my younger brother Luigi, have to defeated creatures that have been coming from the sewers below New York City,&quot; Mario's profile reads.\nThe profile details Mario's education, skills, and work experience.

In 51 of the incidents, the drone-to-aircraft proximity was 50 feet or less, according to the report by Bard College's Center for the Study of the Drone in Annandale-On-Hudson, New York.\n \tThe report is based on an analysis of government records detailing 921 incidents involving drones and manned aircraft between Dec. 17, 2013, and Sept. 12, 2015. Researchers cautioned that when flying at high speeds it can be difficult for a pilot to judge the distance between themselves and another object.\n \tThe majority of the incidents, 64.5 per cent, were sightings of drones in the vicinity of other aircraft with no immediate threat of collision.\n \tThe FAA has previously released data on reports of drone sightings, but the Bard report is the first comprehensive analysis of the sightings by researchers outside the aviation community. Its findings are likely to fuel more debate over how much of a threat drones are to manned aircraft as the government struggles with how to reap the benefits of unmanned aircraft without undermining safety.\n \tMost of the sightings analyzed in the report occurred within 5 miles of an airport and at altitudes higher than 400 feet even though the FAA prohibits flying most drones near airports or over 400 feet.\n \tThe locations with the most incidents were New York/Newark, New Jersey, 86; Los Angeles, 39; Miami, 24; Chicago, 20; Boston, 20; San Jose, 19; Washington, DC, 19; Atlanta, 17; Seattle, 17; San Diego, 14; Orlando, 13; Houston, 12; Portland, Oregon, 12; Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas, 11, and Denver, 10.\n \tThere have been no confirmed collisions between drones and manned aircraft in the U.S. thus far. Government and industry officials have expressed concern that if a drone -- much like a bird -- is sucked into an aircraft engine, smashes a cockpit windshield or damages a critical aircraft surface area, it could cause an air crash.\n \t&quot;With sufficient speed, bird strikes have been known to penetrate the cockpit,&quot; the report said. &quot;It's entirely possible, then, that a drone could also break through into a cockpit, potentially causing serious harm to the pilots or other occupants.&quot;\n \tHelicopter blades are considered especially vulnerable. Thirty-eight of the near collisions identified by researchers involved helicopters.\n \tAircraft engine manufacturers currently test the ability of engines to withstand bird strikes by firing dead birds at the engines at high velocities. The FAA hasn't yet said when it will require engine makers to conduct tests with drones, but officials have unofficially acknowledged they are working on the issue, the report said.\n \tThe report cited research by engineers at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg, Virginia, that used data on bird strikes to create computer simulations of drones striking planes in order to identify the riskiest impact locations. They concluded that hobby drones weighing between 2 and 6 pounds &quot;can potentially cause critical damage.&quot;\n \tThe FAA is in the process of finalizing rules for the use of commercial drones weighing less than 5 pounds. The agency is also expected to shortly issue rules requiring the registration of small drones, including those used by hobbyists, in an effort to help create a &quot;culture of responsibility&quot; among drone operators.

In July, Polish police arrested a man after the drone he was operating came within 110 metres of a Lufthansa passenger jet as it was landing in Warsaw.\nKealey said Ottawa International Airport has not had any emergency situations caused by drones but there have been reports of the unmanned aircraft flying around the airport.\nTransport Canada\u2019s safety guidelines issued for the holiday season remind drone operators that they are not to fly within nine kilometres of an airport.\nDrones should not be flown higher than 90 metres above the ground, in populated areas, or near large groups of people, including sporting events, concerts or festivals or closer than 150 metres to\u00A0people, animals or buildings, the department pointed out.\nBut it is not uncommon for such rules to be broken.\n\u201CMany Canadians will receive drones over the holidays this year, and all new users should learn how to fly them safely and legally before enjoying their new gift,\u201D Transport Minister Marc Garneau said in a statement. \u201CEnsuring people in the skies and on the ground stay safe is a shared\u00A0responsibility\u2014always\u00A0think safety first.\u201D\nVancouver\u2019s public education campaign includes \u201CNo Drone\u201D signs at key locations around the airport as well as advertising and presentations at public events.\nThe federal government has indicated it will bring in stricter rules governing drones in the new year.\nThose using such aircraft for commercial or research purposes must hold a special certificate issued by Transport Canada.

The FAA prohibits drones and model airplanes from flying higher than 400 feet or within five miles of an airport. \nDrones have become increasingly popular with hobbyists. The FAA estimates that 1.6 million small unmanned aircraft will be sold this year, with half during the last three months of the year. \nThe drones must be marked with the owner's unique registration number. The FAA said that would let authorities track down owners if they violate the rules. But registration also gives the agency a vehicle to educate owners just as thousands get drones as presents for Christmas and other holidays. \nThe requirement covers aircraft weighing from more than half pound up to 55 pounds, including any payload such as a camera. Drone owners who are 13 and older will have to register on an FAA website that becomes available starting Dec. 21. The FAA expects parents to register for younger children. \nRegistration will cost $5 and must be renewed every three years, but the fee will be waived for the first 30 days, until Jan. 20. Owners will have to mark aircraft with an identification number. Recreational fliers can register as many aircraft as they want on one registration number. \nMost people who fly drones and model aircraft have little aviation experience, but they become pilots as soon as they start to fly, said Deputy FAA Administrator Michael Whitaker. &quot;They have the responsibility to fly safely, and there are rules and regulations that apply to them,&quot; he said. \nThose who got drones before Dec. 21 must register by Feb. 19. People who buy them later must register before their first outdoor flight. \nOwners will have to provide their name, home address and email, and their identity will be verified and payments made by credit card, the agency said.\nThe FAA said it used some of the recommendations from a task force appointed by Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. \nThe move disappointed a large group representing model airplane users. The Muncie, Ind.-based Academy of Model Aeronautics said registration is an &quot;unnecessary burden for our more than 185,000 members who have been operating safely for decades.&quot;\nThe group maintains that Congress in 2012 prohibited the FAA from new rules for recreational model aircraft users who are part of a community-based organization. \nBut Whitaker said that while the law prohibits new rules, the FAA has the authority to register the aircraft. \nMost model airplanes and even some flying toys weigh more than a half-pound and may need to be registered, the academy said. \nThe requirement won support from others, including the Air Line Pilots Association, which said it is a tool to help make sure that drone owners share the skies safely with airplanes. The association would like to see registration required when unmanned aircraft are sold. \nGovernment and industry officials have expressed concern that drones, like birds, could be sucked into an aircraft engine, smash a cockpit windshield or damage a critical aircraft surface area and cause a crash. \nDrones are responsible for at least 28 recent instances in which pilots veered off course to avoid a collision, according to an analysis of FAA reports by Bard College's Center for the Study of the Drone in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y.\nAircraft engine manufacturers test the ability of engines to withstand bird strikes by firing dead birds at the engines at high velocities.

Transport Canada says fully half of the incidents involving UAV\u2019s it\u2019s investigated this year have been in the province.\nIn August, rogue drones forced wildfire crews in the Okanagan to ground their helicopters for hours while police tried to clear the device from the area.\nAnd at the Vancouver International Airport, there have been repeated incidents of people flying drones near the flight path of commercial aircraft, something airport officials say is extremely dangerous.\nThere have also been several reports this year of \u201Cdrone peeping toms\u201D in locations around the province.\nB.C. drone squad?\nDespite the growing issues, there appears to be no anti-drone squad in the works for B.C.\nLocal authorities have instead opted for public information campaigns and legislation.\nYVR today launched a new campaign\u00A0reminding drone pilots of a ban on flying within 9km of the airport, and threatening violators with a $25,000 fine. The authority will place \u201Cno drone zone\u201D signs at key areas around Sea Island.\nIn September, the province launched it\u2019s own publicity campaign to remind operators of existing rules, fine warnings, and a promise to draft new legislation in 2016.\nThe Federal government requires special permission to fly drones over 25 kg, has published extensive guidelines for operation of smaller craft, and is currently reviewing its regulations.\nBut when asked about a plan to force rogue devices from the sky, officials with the Provincial Ministry of Justice and Ministry of Forest Lands and Natural Resources referred the question to the RCMP.\nThe Mounties are known to have experimented with drones for video applications, and say they\u2019re open to researching and occasionally testing new tools to deal with emerging technology, but wouldn\u2019t discuss \u201Cdrone countermeasures.\u201D And\u00A0Vancouver Police say they own no drones, and have no plan to acquire any.\nThe question, of course, is how to enforce the regulations without new tools.\nDavid Carlos, who operates a UAV training school in Victoria, says he fears real enforcement won\u2019t appear until there\u2019s a tragedy.\n\u201CGod forbid, but there will be an accident. And the guy will get caught, the handcuffs will go on, and there will be a media public spectacle, and they will be carted off to jail to spend a life sentence because they either brought an aircraft down or they could have.\u201D\nHe says he\u2019s been calling for police drones for some time, because the technology is becoming easier and easier to access.\nCarlos says the Japanese idea looks impractical, but he says it would be fairly simple for police to own their own drones which could be used to follow a rogue device back to its operator to make an arrest.\n", :normalized_score_absolute=>42.071999999999996, :normalized_score_relative=>23.687448303444015}, {:title=>"Getting a drone for Christmas?

Its website says since 2010 it has launched 50 investigations across the country into incidents involving unmanned air vehicles.\u00A0\nEven if you don't live near an airport, Langille said drone pilots must be aware of the potential for nearby aircraft. &quot;In Halifax we have LifeFlight and the Sea Kings,&quot; he said. &quot;They're active 24/7, depending what's going on, and a lot of people are not aware they may be in the area so you need to know your surroundings and keep an eye out.&quot;\nIs privacy an issue?\nHalifax privacy lawyer and drone pilot David Fraser told CBC News drone pilots need to use common sense and be good neighbours. He said most people don't understand the technology and how intrusive or not intrusive it is, so it's safe to assume they're going to be &quot;creeped out&quot; by drones flying near their property.\u00A0\n&quot;When you see one of these things flying around, you have no idea what its capabilities are,&quot; he said. &quot;The vast majority of consumer drones have wide-angle lenses that are essentially designed to take breath-taking landscape shots. To get information about an individual or creep in on their windows, the thing would have to be extremely close to you and the ones I have experience with are quite loud, so they're not really going to be stealthily sneaking up on people.&quot;\nHe said there have been reports of people living in a Vancouver high rise opening their blinds to see something hovering outside their window. Fraser said if it's a circumstance\u00A0where somebody has an expectation of privacy, such as where it's hovering outside a bedroom or bathroom window, the criminal code provisions on voyeurism\u00A0could apply.\nIn terms of flying over private property, &quot;That's actually a little bit complicated because airplanes don't have to get your permission to fly over your property, but when it comes to something lower, below 100 feet or below the tops of peoples' houses, that can constitute civil trespass and you could sue somebody for damages,&quot; he said. &quot;If you're flying above that but you're interfering with the normal enjoyment of the property, then that's something called nuisance.&quot;\nFraser cautions drone users to be aware of the Transport Canada requirements if they use the machine for anything other than fun.\nMeanwhile, Flitelab's Langille is urging new drone owners to take it slow and have fun, but be safe.\n&quot;It's going to be an interesting week after Christmas,&quot; he said. &quot;There's going to be a lot of people that don't get very far with them just from inexperience and there'll be other people flying where they shouldn't be.&quot;\n", :normalized_score_absolute=>42.2592, :normalized_score_relative=>24.300008180553917}, {:title=>"Drones 'not simply toys,' warns Transport Canada", :url=>"http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/drones-not-simply-toys-warns-transport-canada-1.2703794", :source=>"CTV News", :score=>-0.136383, :type=>"negative", :content=>" \tDrones are expected to be one of the hottest Christmas gifts this year, with analysts estimating 1.6 million will be sold in North American by the end of 2015.\n \tBut federal officials and airline pilots are trying to raise awareness that, in addition to capturing spectacular images, drones can pose serious safety risks.\n \t\u201CDrones are not simply toys,\u201D said Shari Currie of Transport Canada, which has teamed-up with Vancouver International Airport to launch an awareness campaign.\n \t\u201CThey are aircraft and they do need to be operated safely and legally.\u201D\n \tAmong the biggest risks are those posed to aircraft.\n \tTransport Canada says it\u2019s unsafe to fly drones (also known as unmanned aerial vehicles) within nine kilometres of airports, heliports and aerodromes, or more than 90 metres above the ground.\n \tThey also shouldn\u2019t be flown within 150 metres of people, animals, buildings, structures or vehicles, in populated areas or near large groups, according to Transport Canada\u2019s guidelines.\n \tB.C. airline pilot Dylan Thomas said the thought of being distracted by a drone \u201Cor in the worst case, a collision with a drone, is actually a bit frightening.\u201D\n \tThere have been so many close encounters between drones and aircraft in the U.S. -- at least 241 according to one recent study -- that the Federal Aviation Administration now requires drones be registered.\n \tCurrently, only drones weighing more than 35 kilograms need permits in Canada.\n \tTransport Canada is considering new requirements, but in the meantime it plans to continue educating the public about the risks.\n", :normalized_score_absolute=>43.18085, :normalized_score_relative=>27.315851186634795}, {:title=>"Aviation industry aims to make airports a \u2018no drone zone\u2019", :url=>"http://globalnews.ca/news/2403814/aviation-industry-aims-to-make-airports-a-no-drone-zone/", :source=>"Global News", :score=>-0.0168556, :type=>"negative", :content=>"Drone sales are soaring and that has a lot of people in the aviation industry more than a little concerned.\n\u201CRetail analysts are predicting the sale of more than one million drones across North America this holiday season,\u201D Steve Hankinson, Vancouver Airport Authority vice president, said.\nThat\u2019s why Transport Canada and Vancouver International Airport launched a no drone zone campaign.\nREAD MORE:\u00A0Pilot reports of drone sightings more than double this year and the year\u2019s not over \n\u201CAs a pilot, I can tell you the most critical part of our operation is our take off and landing phase, which happens at the airport,\u201D pilot Dylan Thomas said. \u201CThe thought of being distracted by a drone, or in the worst case a collision with a drone, is actually a bit frightening and terrifying.\u201D\nYesterday, the U.S Federal Aviation Administration announced new regulations that state virtually every drone weighing more than 250 grams must be registered.
