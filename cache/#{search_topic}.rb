Created from locally-sourced ingredients, handcrafted in small batches, and offering unique and delicious flavour combos, these ice cream makers have really cultivated a niche market, expanding the city\u2019s ice cream horizons. Now a new kid on the block, named\u00A0Say Hello Sweets,\u00A0is\u00A0making gourmet ice cream.\nWe spoke with Say Hello Sweets\u00A0founder Naomi Arnaut\u00A0about her ice cream, and how a junior restaurant manager made her way\u00A0into the ice cream-making business.\nWhy ice cream?\nThe allure with ice cream is that the flavour possibilities are absolutely endless and it\u2019s just so nostalgic, you know? I remember that adrenaline rush as a kid hearing the ice cream truck playing its tune.\nGrowing up, ice cream was a rare treat, an indulgence shared with friends and family. It brings people together and that\u2019s what I want Say Hello Sweets to be all about. That idea of community is where the business name came from too.\u00A0It\u2019s an invitation to come say hello, meet a new friend, and of course, eat the finest ice cream. I\u2019m at my happiest when I get a chance to share what I\u2019ve created with people. Even on the coldest, rainiest Vancouver nights families and groups of friends will seek out ice cream.\nWhat makes your ice cream stand out?\nI\u2019ve been sourcing out the best possible ingredients and I only use whole foods. Cream, egg yolks, cane sugar and sea salt form the base. Coconut or cashew milk is used for the plant-based alternatives. I make small batches by hand, made-to-order, rather than keep stock sitting in freezers. Many of my recipes include ingredients that my partner and I grew on our roof top garden right here in the city.\nI\u2019m always coming up with new flavours. I\u2019m currently perfecting a plant-based coconut, lemon and saffron recipe. I have mainstays too, which include honey black sesame, maple rhubarb, cereal milk, twisted mint chocolate chunk, sea salt with caramel ribbons, strawberry basil, Tahitian vanilla, and chocolate chili.\nWhat is your day job?\nI work full-time in a junior management position for Burgoo Bistro. It\u2019s a very supportive company to work for and I\u2019ve learned so much about what it takes to build a successful restaurant and keep it successful in this city. Owning a restaurant in Vancouver is a daunting task with a high failure rate. Burgoo has that recipe down. I feel lucky to be a part of such a fantastic team.\nHow did making ice cream become a part of your life?\nIt was accidental. My dog went into emergency surgery this past spring and I had to finance the bill \u2014 at a very high interest rate. I knew I couldn\u2019t afford the payments but I love my dog and would do absolutely anything for her. It was so hot this summer so I decided I\u2019d attempt to make ice cream and host a tasting for friends and family to fundraise to off-set the debt. I\u2019d never made ice cream before but I completely fell in love with the process, and thankfully, after some trial and error the recipes turned out to be really delicious. My friends, family and co-workers started placing orders regularly. The vet bills literally got paid one pint of ice cream at a time.\nThe next step is getting Say Hello Sweets mobile. I purchased a 1983 Grumman Kurbmaster and I plan to transform it into an ice cream and\u00A0coffee food truck. It\u2019s just a blank slate at the moment and it needs a new engine but it\u2019s a start!\u00A0And this is where I need a little help from all those ice cream lovers out there. With the talents of some close friends I was able to make a short campaign video to share where Say Hello Sweets started and all the places I hope to take it in the near future.\nCurrently, ice cream is made-to-order and pints are available by donation. I\u2019m just in the beginning stages and so excited to grow and be able to share my creations with a wider audience. The goal is to be on the streets, at festivals and catering private events by summer, 2016.\nYou can support Say Hello Sweets through Arnaut\u2019s\u00A0Kickstarter campaign, which will help get the\u00A0independently-owned\u00A0Say Hello Sweets truck on the road. \n", :normalized_score_absolute=>67.74405, :normalized_score_relative=>77.3026861429818}, {:title=>"Project HELLO aims to connect DTES residents with loved ones", :url=>"http://www.vancitybuzz.com/2015/12/project-hello-downtown-eastside/", :source=>"vancitybuzz.com", :score=>0.368638, :type=>"positive", :content=>"A grassroots organization\u00A0called Project HELLO wants to connect Downtown Eastside residents with long lost family members this holiday season.\nSince 2009, Dr. Charles Best Secondary School counsellor Kristi Blakeway has helped hundreds of homeless people\u00A0reconnect with loved ones through handmade Christmas cards.

They have since helped over 450 homeless people in the following years.\nAnd now it\u2019s a year-round project.
